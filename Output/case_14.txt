when a federal administrative agency first issues a rule interpreting one of its regulations,it is generally not required to follow the rulemaking procedures of the administrative procedure act apa or act.see b a.the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit has nevertheless held,in a line of cases beginning with paralyzed veterans of am.arena,that an agency must use the apa procedures when it wishes to issue a new interpretation of a regulation that deviates significantly from one the agency has previously adopted.the question in these cases is whether the rule announced in paralyzed veterans is consistent with the apa.we hold that it is not.
i join the opinion of the court except for part.i agree that the doctrine of paralyzed veterans of america arena,cadc,is incompatible with the administrative procedure act.the creation of that doctrine may have been prompted by an understandable concern about the aggrandizement of the power of administrative agencies as a result of the combined effect of the effective delegation to agencies by congress of huge swaths of lawmaking authority,the exploitation by agencies of the uncertain boundary between legislative and interpretive rules,and this court cases holding that courts must ordinarily defer to an agency interpretation of its own ambiguous regulations.see bowles seminole rock sand.i do not dismiss these concerns,but the paralyzed veterans doctrine is not a viable cure for these problems.at least one of the three factors noted above,however,concerns a matter that can be addressed by this court.the opinions of justice scalia and justice thomas offer substantial reasons why the seminole rock doctrine may be incorrect.see also christopher smithkline beecham,slip,at citing,inter alia,manning,constitutional structure and judicial deference to agency interpretations of agency rules,colum.i await a case in which the validity of seminole rock may be explored through full briefing and argument.
the apa exempts interpretive rules from these requirements.b a.but this concession to agencies was meant to be more modest in its effects than it is today.for despite exempting interpretive rules from notice and comment,the act provides that the reviewing court shall interpret constitutional and statutory provisions,and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.emphasis added.the act thus contemplates that courts,not agencies,will authoritatively resolve ambiguities in statutes and regulations.in such a regime,the exemption for interpretive rules does not add much to agency power.an agency may use interpretive rules to advise the public by explaining its interpretation of the law.but an agency may not use interpretive rules to bind the public by making law,because it remains the responsibility of the court to decide whether the law means what the agency says it means.
the framers expected article iii judges to engage in similar efforts,by applying the law as a check on the excesses of both the legislative and executive branches.see,elliot,debates in the several conventions on the adoption of the federal constitution marshall if the government of the united states make a law not warranted by any of the powers enumerated,it would be considered by the judges as an infringement of the constitution which they are to guard.they would declare it void see also vile.the framers contemplated the constitution,as a rule for the government of courts,as well as of the legislature.marbury madison,cranch.thus,if a case involved a conflict between a law and the constitution,judges would have a duty to adhere to the latter and disregard the former.the federalist,at hamilton see also marbury,cranch,at.similarly,if a case involved an executive effort to extend a law beyond its meaning,judges would have a duty to adhere to the law that had been properly promulgated under the constitution,at considering the scope of the president constitutional power of appointment.as this court said long ago,t he particular phraseology of the constitution of the united states confirms and strengthens the principle,supposed to be essential to all written constitutions,that a law repugnant to the constitution is void and that courts,as well as other departments,are bound by that instrument.at.
seminole rock deference,however,precludes judges from independently determining that meaning.rather than judges applying recognized tools of interpretation to determine the best meaning of a regulation,this doctrine demands that courts accord controlling weight to the agency interpretation of a regulation,subject only to the narrow exception for interpretations that are plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.that deference amounts to a transfer of the judge exercise of interpretive judgment to the agency.see johnson,dictionary of the english language ed.defining d efer as to leave to another judgment but the agency,as part of the executive branch,lacks the structural protections for independent judgment adopted by the framers,including the life tenure and salary protections of article iii.because the agency is thus not properly constituted to exercise the judicial power under the constitution,the transfer of interpretive judgment raises serious concerns.
but i think there is another solution one unavailable to the circuit since it involves the overruling of one this court decisions that being even a greater fault than merely ignoring the apa.as i have described elsewhere,the rule of chevron,if it did not comport with the apa,at least was in conformity with the long history of judicial review of executive action,where s tatutory ambiguities were left to reasonable resolution by the executive.united states mead,scalia,dissenting.i am unaware of any such history justifying deference to agency interpretations of its own regulations.and there are weighty reasons to deny a lawgiver the power to write ambiguous laws and then be the judge of what the ambiguity means.see decker northwest environmental defense center,scalia,concurring in part and dissenting in part slip,at.i would therefore restore the balance originally struck by the apa with respect to an agency interpretation of its own regulations,not by rewriting the act in order to make up for auer,but by abandoning auer and applying the act as written.the agency is free to interpret its own regulations with or without notice and comment but courts will decide with no deference to the agency whether that interpretation is correct.
this accumulation of governmental powers allows agencies to change the meaning of regulations at their discretion and without any advance notice to the parties.it is precisely this problem that the united states court of appeals for the circuit attempted to address by requiring agencies to undertake notice and comment procedures before substantially revising definitive interpretations of regulations.paralyzed veterans,supra.though legally erroneous,the court of appeals reasoning was practically sound.when courts give controlling weight to an administrative interpretation of a regulation instead of to the best interpretation of it they effectively give the interpretation and not the regulation the force and effect of law.to regulated parties,the new interpretation might as well be a new regulation.
this reading of the apa conflates the differing purposes of and of the act.section defines what a rulemaking is.it does not,however,say what procedures an agency must use when it engages in rulemaking.that is the purpose of.and specifically exempts interpretive rules from the requirements that apply to legislative rules.so,the circuit correctly read of the apa to mandate that agencies use the same procedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they used to issue the rule in the first instance.see fcc fox television stations,the apa make s no distinction between initial agency action and subsequent agency action undoing or revising that action where the court went wrong was in failing to apply that accurate understanding of to the exemption for interpretive rules contained in because an agency is not required to use procedures to issue an initial interpretive rule,it is also not required to use those procedures when it amends or repeals that interpretive rule.
as for guernsey,that case is fully consistent with indeed,confirms what the text of the apa makes plain interpretive rules do not require notice and comment.at.sidestepping this inconvenient language,mba instead quotes a portion of the court opinion stating that apa rulemaking would still be required if an agency adopted a new position inconsistent with existing regulations.at.but the statement on which mba relies is dictum.worse,it is dictum taken out of context.the regulations to which the court referred were two provisions of the medicare reimbursement scheme.and it is apparent from the court description of these regulations in part ii of the opinion that they were legislative rules,issued through the process.see,at noting that the disputed regulations were codified in the code of federal regulations.read properly,then,the cited passage from guernsey merely means that an agency may only change its interpretation if the revised interpretation is consistent with the underlying regulations.brief for petitioners in.
the circuit reversed.mortgage bankers harris.bound to the rule of paralyzed veterans by precedent,the court of appeals rejected the government call to abandon the doctrine,at.in the court view,t he only question properly before it was whether the district court had erred in requiring mba to prove that it relied on the department prior interpretation,at.explaining that reliance was not a required element of the paralyzed veterans doctrine,and noting the department concession that a prior,conflicting interpretation of the regulations existed,the circuit concluded that the administrator interpretation had to be vacated.
even if the scope of seminole rock deference more closely matched the justification,it would still fail.it is the text of the regulations that have the force and effect of law,not the agency intent.citizens arrange their affairs not on the basis of their legislators unexpressed intent,but on the basis of the law as it is written and promulgated.zuni public school dist.department of education,scalia,dissenting.wyeth levine,thomas,concurring in judgment noting that only federal standards that are set forth in,or necessarily follow from,the statutory text that was produced through the constitutionally required bicameral and presentment procedures not congress purposes and objectives can become the law of the land to be governed by legislated text rather than legislators intentions is what it means to be a government of laws,not of men.zuni public school dist,supra,at scalia,dissenting.only the text of a regulation goes through the procedures established by congress for agency rulemaking.and it is that text on which the public is entitled to rely.for the same reasons that we should not accord controlling weight to postenactment expressions of intent by individual members of congress,see sullivan finkelstein,scalia,concurring in part,we should not accord controlling weight to expressions of intent by administrators of agencies.
a the apa categorical exemption of interpretive rules from the process is fatal to the paralyzed veterans doctrine.the circuit reading of the apa conflates the differing purposes of and of the act.section requires agencies to use the same procedures when they amend or repeal a rule as they used to issue the rule,see,but it does not say what procedures an agency must use when it engages in rulemaking.that is the purpose of.and specifically exempts interpretive rules from requirements.because an agency is not required to use procedures to issue an initial interpretive rule,it is also not required to use those procedures to amend or repeal that rule.
mba asserts that an agency interpretation of a regulation that significantly alters the agency prior interpretation effectively amends the underlying regulation.that assertion conflicts with the ordinary meaning of the words amend and interpret,and it is impossible to reconcile with the longstanding recognition that interpretive rules do not have the force and effect of law.mba theory is particularly odd in light of the limitations of the paralyzed veterans doctrine,which applies only when an agency has previously adopted an interpretation of its regulation.mba fails to explain why its argument regarding revised interpretations should not also extend to the agency first interpretation.christensen harris county,and shalala guernsey memorial hospital,distinguished.
the text of the apa answers the question presented.section of the apa provides that notice of proposed rule making shall be published in the federal register.b.when such notice is required by the apa,the agency shall give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making.c.but further states that unless notice or hearing is required by statute,the act requirement does not apply to interpretative rules.b a.this exemption of interpretive rules from the process is categorical,and it is fatal to the rule announced in paralyzed veterans.
the paralyzed veterans doctrine creates just such a procedural right the right to notice and an opportunity to comment when an agency changes its interpretation of one of the regulations it enforces.that requirement may be wise policy.or it may not.regardless,imposing such an obligation is the responsibility of congress or the administrative agencies,not the courts.we trust that congress weighed the costs and benefits of placing more rigorous procedural restrictions on the issuance of interpretive rules.see,at when congress enacted the apa,it settled and contentions,and enact ed a formula upon which opposing social and political forces have come to rest internal quotation marks omitted.in the end,congress decided to adopt standards that permit agencies to promulgate freely such rules whether or not they are consistent with earlier interpretations.that the circuit would have struck the balance differently does not permit that court or this one to overturn congress contrary judgment.law siegel,slip,at.
