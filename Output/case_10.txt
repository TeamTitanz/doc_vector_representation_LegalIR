while conducting an offshore inspection of a commercial fishing vessel in the gulf of mexico,a federal agent found that the ship catch contained undersized red grouper,in violation of federal conservation regulations.the officer instructed the ship captain,petitioner yates,to keep the undersized fish segregated from the rest of the catch until the ship returned to port.after the officer departed,yates instead told a crew member to throw the undersized fish overboard.for this offense,yates was charged with destroying,concealing,and covering up undersized fish to impede a federal investigation,in violation of.that section provides that a person may be fined or imprisoned for up to years if he knowingly alters,destroys,mutilates,conceals,covers up,falsifies,or makes a false entry in any record,document,or tangible object with the intent to impede,obstruct,or influence a federal investigation.at trial,yates moved for a judgment of acquittal on the charge.pointing to origin as a provision of the act of,a law designed to protect investors and restore trust in financial markets following the collapse of enron corporation,yates argued that reference to tangible object subsumes objects used to store information,such as computer hard drives,not fish.the district court denied yates motion,and a jury found him guilty of violating.the eleventh circuit affirmed the conviction,concluding that applies to the destruction or concealment of fish because,as objects having physical form,fish fall within the dictionary definition of tangible object.
this moderate interpretation of tangible object accords with the list of actions proscribes.the section applies to anyone who alters,destroys,mutilates,conceals,covers up,falsifies,or makes a false entry in any record,document,or tangible object with the requisite obstructive intent.emphasis added.the last two verbs,falsif y and mak e a false entry in,typically take as grammatical objects records,documents,or things used to record or preserve information,such as logbooks or hard drives.see,black law dictionary ed.defining falsify as t o make deceptive to counterfeit,forge,or misrepresent,to tamper with a document,record.it would be unnatural,for example,to describe a killer act of wiping his fingerprints from a gun as falsifying the murder weapon.but it would not be strange to refer to falsifying data stored on a hard drive as simply falsifying a hard drive.furthermore,congress did not include on c list of prohibited actions falsifies or makes a false entry in.see c making it unlawful to alte r,destro y,mutilat e,or concea l a record,document,or other object with the requisite obstructive intent.that contemporaneous omission also suggests that congress intended tangible object in to have a narrower scope than other object in c. a canon related to noscitur a sociis,ejusdem generis,counsels where general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration,the general words are usually construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.washington state of social and health servs.guardianship estate of keffeler,internal quotation marks omitted.in begay united states,for example,we relied on this principle to determine what crimes were covered by the statutory phrase any crime that is burglary,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,e b ii.the enumeration of specific crimes,we explained,indicates that the otherwise involves provision covers only similar crimes,rather than every crime that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.at.had congress intended the latter all encompassing meaning,we observed,it is hard to see why it would have needed to include the examples at all.ibid.see also csx,alabama of revenue,slip,at we typically use ejusdem generis to ensure that a general word will not render specific words meaningless.just so here.had congress intended tangible object in to be interpreted so generically as to capture physical objects as dissimilar as documents and fish,congress would have had no reason to refer specifically to record or document.the government unbounded reading of tangible object would render those words misleading surplusage.
we note first caption destruction,alteration,or falsification of records in federal investigations and bankruptcy.that heading conveys no suggestion that the section prohibits spoliation of any and all physical evidence,however remote from records.neither does the title of the section of the act in which was placed,criminal penalties for altering documents.stat.furthermore,the only other provision passed as part of,is titled destruction of corporate audit records and addresses only that specific subset of records and documents.while these headings are not commanding,they supply cues that congress did not intend tangible object in to sweep within its reach physical objects of every kind,including things no one would describe as records,documents,or devices closely associated with them.see united states,t he title of a statute and the heading of a section are tools available for the resolution of a doubt about the meaning of a statute.internal quotation marks omitted.if congress indeed meant to make an ban on the spoliation of evidence,as the dissent believes congress did,one would have expected a clearer indication of that intent.
finally,if our recourse to traditional tools of statutory construction leaves any doubt about the meaning of tangible object,as that term is used in,we would invoke the rule that ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.cleveland united states,quoting rewis united states.that interpretative principle is relevant here,where the government urges a reading of that exposes individuals to prison sentences for tampering with any physical object that might have evidentiary value in any federal investigation into any offense,no matter whether the investigation is pending or merely contemplated,or whether the offense subject to investigation is criminal or civil.see liparota united states,application of the rule of lenity ensures that criminal statutes will provide fair warning concerning conduct rendered illegal and strikes the appropriate balance between the legislature,the prosecutor,and the court in defining criminal liability.in determining the meaning of tangible object in,it is appropriate,before we choose the harsher alternative,to require that congress should have spoken in language that is clear and definite.see cleveland,at quoting united states universal credit.see also jones united states,rule of lenity reinforces the conclusion that arson of an residence is not subject to federal prosecution under i because such a residence does not qualify as property used in commerce or activity.
the reason for that wise rule is easy to see a title is,almost necessarily,an abridgment.attempting to mention every term in a statute would often be ungainly as well as useless accordingly,matters in the text are frequently unreflected in the headings.at.just last year,this court observed that two titles in a nearby section of serve as but a reference to the general subject matter of the provision at issue,not meant to take the place of the detailed provisions of the text.lawson fmr llc,slip,at quoting trainmen,at.the of the headings,we stated,was apparent.lawson,at slip,at.so too for title,which refers to destruction,alteration,or falsification but not to mutilation,concealment,or covering up,and likewise mentions records but not other documents or objects.presumably,the plurality would not refuse to apply when a person only conceals evidence rather than destroying,altering,or falsifying it instead,the plurality would say that a title is just a title,which can not undo or limit more specific statutory text.ibid.quoting trainmen,at.the same holds true when the evidence in question is not a record but something else whose destruction,alteration,is intended to obstruct justice.
the words immediately surrounding tangible object in falsifies,or makes a false entry in any record or document also cabin the contextual meaning of that term.applying the canons noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis,tangible object,as the last in a list of terms that begins any record or document,is appropriately read to refer,not to any tangible object,but specifically to the subset of tangible objects used to record or preserve information.this moderate interpretation accords with the list of actions proscribes the verbs falsif y and mak e a false entry in typically take as grammatical objects records,documents,or things used to record or preserve information,such as logbooks or hard drives.see gustafson alloyd.
for reasons not disclosed in the record before us,more than months passed before criminal charges were lodged against yates.on may,he was indicted for destroying property to prevent a federal seizure,in violation of a,and for destroying,concealing,and covering up undersized fish to impede a federal investigation,in violation of by the time of the indictment,the minimum legal length for gulf red grouper had been lowered from inches to inches.see cfr d iv effective may.no measured fish in yates catch fell below that limit.the record does not reveal what civil penalty,if any,yates received for his possession of fish undersized under the regulation.see a.
yates was tried on the criminal charges in august.at the end of the government case in chief,he moved for a judgment of acquittal on the charge.pointing to title and its origin as a provision of the act,yates argued that the section sets forth a documents offense and that its reference to tangible object s subsumes computer hard drives,logbooks,and things of that nature,not fish.app.yates acknowledged that the criminal code contains sections that would have been appropriate for the g overnment to pursue if it wished to prosecute him for tampering with evidence.app.section a,set out supra,at,fit that description.but,yates insisted,did not.
the plurality next tries to divine meaning from position within chapter of title.ante,at.but that move is yet odder than the last.as far as i can tell,this court has never once suggested that the section number assigned to a law bears upon its meaning.scalia,supra,at listing more than interpretive principles and canons without mentioning the plurality new theory.and even on its own terms,the plurality argument is hard to fathom.the plurality claims that if applied to objects generally,congress would not have placed it after the,and because those are specialized provisions.ante,at.but search me if i can find a better place for a broad ban on.the plurality seems to agree that the law properly goes in chapter the criminal code chapter on obstruction of justice.but the provision does not logically fit into any of that chapter sections.and with the first numbers of the chapter already taken starting with and continuing through,the law naturally took the place.that is standard operating procedure.prior to the act of,all of chapter was ordered chronologically section was later enacted than,which was later enacted than,which was well,you get the idea.and after,congress has continued in the same vein.section is thus right where you would expect it as is the contemporaneously passed between added in and added in.
begin with the way the surrounding words in reinforce the breadth of the term at issue.section refers to any tangible object,thus indicating in line with that word plain meaning a tangible object of whatever kind.webster third new international dictionary.this court has time and again recognized that any has an expansive meaning,bringing within a statute reach all types of the item here,tangible object to which the law refers.department of housing and urban development rucker,see,republic of iraq beaty,ali federal bureau of prisons.and the adjacent laundry list of verbs in alters,destroys,mutilates,conceals,covers up,falsifies,or makes a false entry further shows that congress wrote a statute with a wide scope.those words are supposed to ensure just as tangible object is meant to that covers the whole world of,in all its prodigious variety.see united states rodgers,rejecting a narrow,technical definition of a statutory term when it clashes strongly with sweeping language in the same sentence.
justice alito concluded that traditional rules of statutory construction confirm that yates has the better argument.title list of nouns,list of verbs,and title,when combined,tip the case in favor of yates.applying the canons noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis to the list of nouns any record,document,or tangible object the term tangible object should refer to something similar to records or documents.and while many of verbs alters,destroys,mutilates,conceals,covers up,falsifies,or makes a false entry in could apply to nouns such as salamanders or sand dunes,the term makes a false entry in makes no sense outside of filekeeping.finally,title destruction,alteration,or falsification of records in federal investigations and bankruptcy also points toward filekeeping rather than fish.
indeed,the inclusion of c in creates a far worse problem for the plurality construction of than for mine.section c criminalizes the destruction of any record,document,or other object of any record,document,or tangible object.on the plurality view,one object is really an object,whereas the other is only an object that preserves or stores information.but t he normal rule of statutory construction assumes that identical words used in different parts of the same act,passed at the same time,are intended to have the same meaning.sorenson secretary of treasury,internal quotation marks omitted.and that is especially true when the different provisions pertain to the same subject.see supra,at.the plurality does really,ca explain why it instead interprets the same words used in two provisions of the same act addressing the same basic problem to mean fundamentally different things.
the legislative history reveals that c was drafted and proposed after.see cong.rec.the government argues,and yates does not dispute,that c reference to other object includes any and every physical object.but if reference to tangible object already included all physical objects,as the government and the dissent contend,then congress had no reason to enact c virtually any act that would violate c no doubt would violate as well,for applies to the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter,not just to an official proceeding.
anyway,assigning tangible object its ordinary meaning comports with noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis when applied,as they should be,with attention to subject and purpose.those canons require identifying a common trait that links all the words in a statutory phrase.see,graham county soil and water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson,ali,at.in responding to that demand,the plurality characterizes records and documents as things that preserve information and so they are.but just as much,they are things that provide information,and thus potentially serve as evidence relevant to matters under review.and in a statute pertaining to obstruction of federal investigations,that evidentiary function comes to the fore.the destruction of records and documents prevents law enforcement agents from gathering facts relevant to official inquiries.and so too does the destruction of tangible objects of whatever kind.whether the item is a fisherman ledger or an undersized fish,throwing it overboard has the identical effect on the administration of justice.see supra,at.for purposes of,records,documents,and all tangible objects are therefore alike.
the government countered that a tangible object within compass is simply something other than a document or record.app.the trial judge expressed misgivings about reading tangible object as broadly as the government urged is there a latin phrase about construction of a statute.the gist of it is you take a look at a line of words,and you interpret the words consistently.so if you talking about documents,and records,tangible objects are tangible objects in the nature of a document or a record,as opposed to a fish.ibid.the judge nonetheless followed controlling eleventh circuit precedent.while recognizing that was passed as part of legislation targeting corporate fraud,the court of appeals had instructed that the broad language of is not limited to corporate fraud cases,and congress is free to pass laws with language covering areas well beyond the particular crisis du jour that initially prompted legislative action.md,app.quoting united states hunt.accordingly,the trial court read tangible object as a term independent of record or document.app.for violating and a,the court sentenced yates to imprisonment for days,followed by supervised release for three years.app.for life,he will bear the stigma of having a federal felony conviction.
supporting a reading of tangible object,as used in,in accord with dictionary definitions,the government points to the appearance of that term in federal rule of criminal procedure.that rule requires the prosecution to grant a defendant request to inspect tangible objects within the government control that have utility for the defense.see fed.rule crim.proc.a e.
rule reference to tangible objects has been interpreted to include any physical evidence.see lafave,israel,king,kerr,criminal procedure g,and ed.rule is a discovery rule designed to protect defendants by compelling the prosecution to turn over to the defense evidence material to the charges at issue.in that context,a comprehensive construction of tangible objects is fitting.in contrast,is a penal provision that refers to tangible object not in relation to a request for information relevant to a specific court proceeding,but rather in relation to federal investigations or proceedings of every kind,including those not yet begun see commissioner national carbide,hand,words are chameleons,which reflect the color of their environment just as the context of rule supports giving tangible object a meaning as broad as its dictionary definition,the context of tugs strongly in favor of a narrower reading.
