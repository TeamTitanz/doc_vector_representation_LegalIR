b neither the lanham act nor the fdca,in express terms,forbids or limits lanham act claims challenging labels that are regulated by the fdca.the absence of such a textual provision when the lanham act and the fdca have coexisted for over years is powerful evidence that congress did not intend fda oversight to be the exclusive means of ensuring proper food and beverage labeling.see wyeth,supra,at.in addition,and contrary to argument,congress,by taking care to only some state laws,if anything indicated it did not intend the fdca to preclude requirements arising from other sources.see setser united states.the structures of the fdca and the lanham act reinforce this conclusion.where two statutes are complementary,it would show disregard for the congressional design to hold that congress intended one federal statute nonetheless to preclude the operation of the other.see ag supply,pioneer int l.the lanham act and the fdca complement each other in major respects,for each has its own scope and purpose.both touch on food and beverage labeling,but the lanham act protects commercial interests against unfair competition,while the fdca protects public health and safety.they also complement each other with respect to remedies.the fdca enforcement is largely committed to the fda,while the lanham act empowers private parties to sue competitors to protect their interests on a basis.allowing lanham act suits takes advantage of synergies among multiple methods of regulation.a holding that the fdca precludes lanham act claims challenging food and beverage labels also could lead to a result that congress likely did not intend.the fda does not necessarily pursue enforcement measures regarding all objectionable labels,preclusion of lanham act claims could leave commercial interests and indirectly the public at large with less effective protection in the food and beverage labeling realm than in other less regulated industries.
so the fdca is the second statute to be discussed.the fdca statutory regime is designed primarily to protect the health and safety of the public at large.see cases of jam united states,fdca,stat,agency may issue certain regulations to promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers the fdca prohibits the misbranding of food and drink.f.a food or drink is deemed misbranded if,inter alia,its labeling is false or misleading,a,information required to appear on its label is not prominently placed thereon,f,or a label does not bear the common or usual name of the food,if any there be,i.to implement these provisions,the food and drug administration fda promulgated regulations regarding food and beverage labeling,including the labeling of mixes of different types of juice into one juice blend.see cfr.one provision of those regulations is particularly relevant to this case if a juice blend does not name all the juices it contains and mentions only juices that are not predominant in the blend,then it must either declare the percentage content of the named juice or i ndicate that the named juice is present as a flavor or flavoring,raspberry and cranberry flavored juice drink.d.the government represents that the fda does not preapprove juice labels under these regulations.see brief for united states as amicus curiae in opposition.that contrasts with the fda regulation of other types of labels,such as drug labels,see d,and is consistent with the less extensive role the fda plays in the regulation of food than in the regulation of drugs.
the ruling that pom lanham act cause of action is precluded by the fdca was incorrect.there is no statutory text or established interpretive principle to support the contention that the fdca precludes lanham act suits like the one brought by pom in this case.nothing in the text,history,or structure of the fdca or the lanham act shows the congressional purpose or design to forbid these suits.quite to the contrary,the fdca and the lanham act complement each other in the federal regulation of misleading food and beverage labels.competitors,in their own interest,may bring lanham act claims like pom that challenge food and beverage labels that are regulated by the fdca.
d the government intermediate position that a lanham act claim is precluded to the extent the fdca or fda regulations specifically require or authorize the challenged aspects of the label,and that this rule precludes pom challenge to the name of product is flawed,for the government assumes that the fdca and its regulations are a ceiling on the regulation of food and beverage labeling when congress intended the lanham act and the fdca to complement each other with respect to labeling.though the fda rulemaking alludes at one point to a balance of interests,it neither discusses nor cites the lanham act and the government points to no other statement suggesting that the fda considered the full scope of interests protected by the lanham act.even if agency regulations with the force of law that purport to bar other legal remedies may do so,it is a bridge too far to accept an agency statement to justify that result here.an agency may not reorder federal statutory rights without congressional authorization.
unlike the lanham act,which relies in substantial part for its enforcement on private suits brought by injured competitors,the fdca and its regulations provide the united states with nearly exclusive enforcement,including the authority to seek criminal sanctions in some circumstances.a.private parties may not bring enforcement suits.also unlike the lanham act,the fdca contains a provision certain state laws on misbranding.that provision,which congress added to the fdca in the nutrition labeling and education act of,stat,forecloses a state or political subdivision of a state from establishing requirements that are of the type but not identical to the requirements in some of the misbranding provisions of the fdca.a.it does not address,or refer to,other federal statutes or the preclusion thereof.
alleging that the use of that label is deceptive and misleading,pom sued under of the lanham act.stat,as amended.that provision allows one competitor to sue another if it alleges unfair competition arising from false or misleading product descriptions.the court of appeals for the ninth circuit held that,in the realm of labeling for food and beverages,a lanham act claim like pom is precluded by a second federal statute.the second statute is the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,which forbids the misbranding of food,including by means of false or misleading labeling,stat,as amended.
beginning with the text of the two statutes,it must be observed that neither the lanham act nor the fdca,in express terms,forbids or limits lanham act claims challenging labels that are regulated by the fdca.by its terms,the lanham act subjects to suit any person who misrepresents the nature,characteristics,qualities,or geographic origin of goods or services.a.this comprehensive imposition of liability extends,by its own terms,to misrepresentations on labels,including food and beverage labels.no other provision in the lanham act limits that understanding or purports to govern the relevant interaction between the lanham act and the fdca.and the fdca,by its terms,does not preclude lanham act suits.in consequence,food and beverage labels regulated by the fdca are not,under the terms of either statute,off limits to lanham act claims.no textual provision in either statute discloses a purpose to bar unfair competition claims like pom.
a this result is based on the following premises.first,this is not a case,for it does not raise the question whether state law is by a federal law,see wyeth levine,but instead concerns the alleged preclusion of a cause of action under one federal statute by the provisions of another federal statute.principles may nonetheless be instructive insofar as they are designed to assess the interaction of laws bearing on the same subject.second,this is a statutory interpretation case and analysis of the statutory text,aided by established interpretation rules,controls.see chickasaw nation united states.while a principle of interpretation may be countered by some maxim pointing in a different direction,circuit city stores,adams,this court need not decide what maxim establishes the proper framework here even assuming that is correct that the court task is to reconcile or harmonize the statutes instead of to determine whether one statute is an implied repeal in part of another statute,is incorrect that the best way to do that is to bar pom lanham act claim.
this case involves the intersection of two federal statutes.the lanham act permits one competitor to sue another for unfair competition arising from false or misleading product descriptions.the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca prohibits the misbranding of food and drink.f.to implement the fdca provisions,the food and drug administration fda has promulgated regulations regarding food and beverage labeling,including one concerning juice blends.unlike the lanham act,which,relies in large part for its enforcement on private suits brought by injured competitors,the fdca and its regulations give the united states nearly exclusive enforcement authority and do not permit private enforcement suits.the fdca also certain state misbranding laws.
the court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed in relevant part.like the district court,the court of appeals reasoned that congress decided to entrust matters of juice beverage labeling to the fda the fda has promulgated comprehensive regulation of that labeling and the fda apparently has not imposed the requirements on label that are sought by pom.u nder circuit precedent,the court of appeals explained,for a court to act when the fda has not despite regulating extensively in this area would risk undercutting the fda expert judgments and authority.at.for these reasons,and o ut of respect for the statutory and regulatory scheme,the court of appeals barred pom lanham act claim,at.
a principle of interpretation is often countered,of course,by some maxim pointing in a different direction.circuit city stores,adams.it is thus unsurprising that in this case a threshold dispute has arisen as to which of two competing maxims establishes the proper framework for decision.pom argues that this case concerns whether one statute,the fdca as amended,is an implied repeal in part of statute,the lanham act.see,carcieri salazar.pom contends that in such cases courts must give full effect to both statutes unless they are in irreconcilable conflict,see,and that this high standard is not satisfied here.resists this canon and its high standard.argues that the case concerns whether a more specific law,the fdca,clarifies or narrows the scope of a more general law,the lanham act.see,united states fausto,brief for respondent.the court task,it claims,is to reconcil e the laws,and it says the best reconciliation is that the more specific provisions of the fdca bar certain causes of action authorized in a general manner by the lanham act.
perhaps the closest the statutes come to addressing the preclusion of the lanham act claim at issue here is the provision added to the fdca in as part of the nutrition labeling and education act.see.but,far from expressly precluding suits arising under other federal laws,the provision if anything suggests that lanham act suits are not precluded.
this absence is of special significance because the lanham act and the fdca have coexisted since the passage of the lanham act in.stat.ch,stat.if congress had concluded,in light of experience,that lanham act suits could interfere with the fdca,it might well have enacted a provision addressing the issue during these years.see wyeth,supra,at if congress thought suits posed an obstacle to its objectives,it surely would have enacted an express provision at some point during the fdca history congress enacted amendments to the fdca and the lanham act,see,nutrition labeling and education act of,stat.trademark law revision act of,stat,including an amendment that added to the fdca an express provision with respect to state laws addressing food and beverage misbranding,stat.yet congress did not enact a provision addressing the preclusion of other federal laws that might bear on food and beverage labeling.this is powerful evidence that congress did not intend fda oversight to be the exclusive means of ensuring proper food and beverage labeling.see wyeth,at.
c arguments do not support its claim that preclusion is proper because congress intended national uniformity in food and beverage labeling.first,the fdca delegation of enforcement authority to the federal government does not indicate that congress intended to foreclose private enforcement of other federal statutes.second,the fdca express provision applies by its terms to state,not federal,law.even if it were proper to stray from that text,it not clear that national uniformity assertions reflect the congressional design.finally,the fdca and its implementing regulations may address food and beverage labeling with more specificity than the lanham act,but this specificity would matter only if the two acts can not be implemented in full at the same time.here,neither the statutory structure nor the empirical evidence of which the court is aware indicates there will be any difficulty in fully enforcing each statute according to its terms.
the district court granted partial summary judgment to on pom lanham act claim,ruling that the fdca and its regulations preclude challenges to the name and label of juice blend.the district court reasoned that in the juice blend regulations the fda has directly spoken on the issues that form the basis of pom lanham act claim against the naming and labeling of product,but has not prohibited any,and indeed expressly has permitted some,aspects of label.supp,cd cal.
