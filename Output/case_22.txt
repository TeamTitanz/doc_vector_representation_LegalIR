the district court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim.it concluded that npdes permits were not required because the ditches,culverts,and channels were not point sources of pollution under the act and the silvicultural rule.the court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed.northwest environmental defense center brown.it relied upon three principal propositions.first,it held that the district court had jurisdiction under notwithstanding a different provision of the act,b,limiting judicial review of epa regulations.second,the court of appeals held that while the epa silvicultural rule is ambiguous on the question whether the conveyances at issue are point sources,those conveyances must be deemed point sources under the rule in order to give effect to the act expansive definition of the term.third,the court of appeals held that because the industrial stormwater rule makes to standard industrial classification,the discharges at issue are associated with industrial activity within the meaning of the regulation,despite the epa conclusion to the contrary.the regulation was held to be unambiguous on this point.the court of appeals thus ruled that the discharges were from point sources and not exempt from the npdes permitting scheme by the industrial stormwater rule.it followed that petitioners had been in violation of the act.
these cases present the question whether the clean water act act and its implementing regulations require permits before channeled stormwater runoff from logging roads can be discharged into the navigable waters of the united states.under the statute and its implementing regulations,a permit is required if the discharges are deemed to be associated with industrial activity.p b.the environmental protection agency epa,with the responsibility to enforce the act,has issued a regulation defining the term associated with industrial activity to cover only discharges from any conveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm water and that is directly related to manufacturing,processing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.cfr b.the epa interprets its regulation to exclude the type of stormwater discharges from logging roads at issue here.see brief for united states as amicus curiae.for reasons now to be explained,the court concludes the epa determination is a reasonable interpretation of its own regulation and,in consequence,deference is accorded to the interpretation under auer robbins.
the preamendment version of the industrial stormwater rule,as permissibly construed by the epa,exempts discharges of channeled stormwater runoff from logging roads from the npdes permitting scheme.the regulation is a reasonable interpretation of the statutory term associated with industrial activity,p b,and the agency has construed the regulation to exempt the discharges at issue here.when an agency interprets its own regulation,the court,as a general rule,defers to it unless that interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.chase bank usa,mccoy,quoting auer robbins.here,it was reasonable for the epa to conclude that the conveyances at issue are directly related only to the harvesting of raw materials,rather than to manufacturing,processing,or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.cfr b.the regulatory scheme,taken as a whole,leaves open the rational interpretation that the regulation extends only to traditional industrial buildings such as factories and associated sites and other relatively fixed facilities.
the clean water act act requires that national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permits be secured before pollutants are discharged from any point source into the navigable waters of the united states.see a.one of the environmental protection agency epa implementing regulations,the silvicultural rule,specifies which types of discharges are point sources.cfr b.these discharges require npdes permits unless some other federal statutory provision exempts them from coverage.one such statutory provision exempts discharges composed entirely of stormwater,p,unless the discharge is associated with industrial activity,p b.under the epa industrial stormwater rule,the term associated with industrial activity covers only discharges from any conveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm water and that is directly related to manufacturing,processing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.cfr b.shortly before oral argument in the instant cases,the epa issued a final version of an amendment to the industrial stormwater rule,clarifying that the npdes permit requirement applies only to logging operations involving rock crushing,gravel washing,log sorting,and log storage facilities,which are all listed in the silvicultural rule.
the epa takes a different view.it concludes that the earlier regulation invoked standard industrial classification to regulate traditional industrial sources such as sawmills.brief for united states as amicus curiae.it points to the regulation reference to facilities and the classification reference to establishments,which suggest industrial sites more fixed and permanent than outdoor operations.ibid.see also fed.reg.this reading is reinforced by the industrial stormwater rule definition of discharges associated with industrial activity as discharges from any conveyance that is used for collecting and conveying storm water and that is directly related to manufacturing,processing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.cfr b.this language lends support to the epa claim that the regulation does not cover temporary,outdoor logging installations.it was reasonable for the agency to conclude that the conveyances at issue are directly related only to the harvesting of raw materials,rather than to manufacturing,processing,or raw materials storage areas.see oxford dict.manufacturing is mak ing something on a large scale using machinery at processing is perform ing a series of mechanical or chemical operations on something in order to change or preserve it in addition,even if logging as a general matter is a type of economic activity within the regulation scope,a reasonable interpretation of the regulation could still require the discharges to be related in a direct way to operations at an industrial plant in order to be subject to npdes permitting.
petitioner west has a contract with oregon to harvest timber from a state forest.when it rains,water runs off two logging roads used by petitioner into ditches,culverts,and channels that discharge the water into nearby rivers and streams.the discharges often contain large amounts of sediment,which evidence shows may be harmful to fish and other aquatic organisms.respondent northwest environmental defense center nedc filed suit against petitioner and state and local governments and officials,including petitioner decker,invoking the act provision,and alleging that the defendants had not obtained npdes permits before discharging stormwater runoff into two oregon rivers.the district court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim,concluding that npdes permits were not required because the ditches,culverts,and channels were not point sources of pollution under the act and the silvicultural rule.the ninth circuit reversed.it held that the conveyances were point sources under the silvicultural rule.it also concluded that the discharges were associated with industrial activity under the industrial stormwater rule,despite the epa contrary conclusion that the regulation excludes the type of stormwater discharges from logging roads at issue.thus,the court held,the discharges were not exempt from the npdes permitting scheme.
the substantive question of the necessity for an npdes permit under the earlier rule now must be addressed.under the act,petitioners were required to secure npdes permits for the discharges of channeled stormwater runoff only if the discharges were associated with industrial activity,p b,as that statutory term is defined in the preamendment version of the industrial stormwater rule,cfr b.otherwise,the discharges fall within the act general exemption of discharges composed entirely of stormwater from the npdes permitting scheme.p.
up to this stage in the litigation,of course,the cases have been concerned with the industrial stormwater rule before the amendment adopted on november.the amended regulation will determine whether from this point forward npdes permits will be required for the stormwater discharges at issue.the parties disagree about the significance of the amended rule for purposes of these cases.before reaching this and other preliminary points,however,it is appropriate to set forth the facts and history of the cases leading to the proceedings in this court.
another reason to accord auer deference to the epa interpretation is that there is no indication that the agency current view is a change from prior practice or is a post hoc justification adopted in response to litigation.see christopher smithkline beecham.rather,the epa has been consistent in its view that the types of discharges at issue do not require npdes permits.its decision also exists against a background of state regulation with respect to stormwater runoff from logging roads.in exercising the broad discretion the act gives the epa in the realm of stormwater runoff,the agency could reasonably have concluded that further federal regulation would be duplicative or counterproductive in light of oregon extensive rules on the subject.
somewhat more plausible is nedc claim that the preamendment version of the industrial stormwater rule unambiguously required a permit for the discharges at issue.nedc reasons that under the rule,f or the categories of industries identified in this section,npdes permits are required for,among other things,storm water discharges from immediate access roads used or traveled by carriers of raw materials.cfr b.yet this raises the question whether logging is a categor y of industr y identified by the section.the regulation goes on to identify a list of categories of facilities that are considered to be engaging in industrial activity for purposes of the industrial stormwater rule.ibid.in the earlier version of the regulation,this list included f acilities classified as standard industrial classificatio n,which encompasses logging.ibid.see also supra,at.hence,nedc asserts,logging is among the categories of industries for which storm water discharges from immediate access roads used or traveled by carriers of raw materials required npdes permits under the earlier version of the industrial stormwater rule.b.nedc further notes,in support of its reading of the regulation,that modern logging is a,highly mechanized enterprise,using sophisticated harvesting machines weighing up to tons.see brief for respondent.
on november,three days before the instant cases were argued in this court the epa issued its final version of an amendment to the industrial stormwater rule.the amendment was the agency response to the court of appeals ruling now under review.the amended version seeks to clarify the types of facilities within standard industrial classification that are deemed to be engaged in industrial activity for purposes of the rule.the amended industrial stormwater rule does not cover all facilities within standard industrial classification.it limits covered stormwater discharges to.
the present action is within the scope of.it is a claim to enforce what is at least a permissible reading of the silvicultural rule.the rule is ambiguous its characterization of silvicultural harvesting operations from which there is natural runoff,cfr b,as a nonpoint source might be read,as petitioners contend,to apply to the channeled stormwater runoff at issue or it might be read,as respondent nedc urges,to apply only to runoff not collected in channels or other engineered improvements.see new oxford american dictionary ed.oxford dict.natural means existing in or caused by nature not made or caused by humankind nedc reading would make the channeled discharges here pollution under the act.in its view only this interpretation can be squared with the act broad definition of point source.on this premise,the instant suit is an effort not to challenge the silvicultural rule but to enforce it under a proper interpretation.it is a basic tenet that regulations,in order to be valid,must be consistent with the statute under which they are promulgated.united states larionoff.
when the act took effect,the epa found it difficult to process permit applications from countless owners and operators of point sources throughout the country.the agency issued regulations exempting certain types of discharges from the npdes permitting scheme,but in those directives were found invalid.the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ruled that the statute did not give the epa authority to exempt categories of point sources from the permit requirements of the act.natural resources defense council,costle.in response the epa issued new regulations to define with more precision which categories of discharges qualified as point sources in the first place.among these regulations was the silvicultural rule.this rule is at issue here.it provides.
nedc resists this conclusion,noting that elsewhere in the industrial stormwater rule the epa has required npdes permits for stormwater discharges associated with other types of outdoor economic activity.see b iii mining b v landfills receiving industrial waste b x large construction sites.the epa reasonably could conclude,however,that these types of activities tend to be more fixed and permanent than operations are and have a closer connection to traditional industrial sites.in light of the language of the regulation just discussed,moreover,the inclusion of these types of economic activity in the industrial stormwater rule need not be read to mandate that all stormwater discharges related to these activities fall within the rule,just as the inclusion of logging need not be read to extend to all discharges from logging sites.the regulation reach may be limited by the requirement that the discharges be directly related to manufacturing,processing or raw materials storage areas at an industrial plant.b.
the other rationale our cases provide is that the agency possesses special expertise in administering its complex and highly technical regulatory program.see,thomas jefferson shalala.that is true enough,and it leads to the conclusion that agencies and not courts should make regulations.but it has nothing to do with who should interpret regulations unless one believes that the purpose of interpretation is to make the regulatory program work in a fashion that the current leadership of the agency deems effective.making regulatory programs effective is the purpose of rulemaking,in which the agency uses its special expertise to formulate the best rule.but the purpose of interpretation is to determine the fair meaning of the rule to say what the law is,marbury madison,cranch.not to make policy,but to determine what policy has been made and promulgated by the agency,to which the public owes obedience.indeed,since the leadership of agencies and hence the policy preferences of agencies changes with presidential administrations,an agency head can only be sure that the application of his special expertise to the issue addressed by a regulation will be given effect if we adhere to predictable principles of textual interpretation rather than defer to the special expertise of his successors.if we take agency enactments as written,the executive has a stable background against which to write its rules and achieve the policy ends it thinks best.
