first,bact looks to the effects of covered pollutants in the area in which a source is located.the psd program is implemented through emission limitations and such other measures as are necessary to prevent significant deterioration of air quality in each region.emphasis added.the clean air act provides that bact must be identified on a basis,and this necessarily means that local conditions must be taken into account.for this reason,the act instructs the epa to issue regulations requiring an analysis of the ambient air quality at the site of the proposed major emitting facil ity and in the area potentially affected by the emissions from such facility for each pollutant regulated under the act.e b emphasis added.the act also requires a public hearing on the air quality at the proposed site and in areas which may be affected by emissions from such facility for each pollutant subject to regulation under the act which will be emitted from such facility.a,e emphasis added.accordingly,if bact is required for greenhouse gases,the act demands that the impact of these gases in the area surrounding a site must be monitored,explored at a public hearing,and considered as part of the permitting process.the effects of greenhouse gases,however,are global,not local.see psd and title v permitting guidance for greenhouse gases hereinafter guidance.as a result,the epa has declared that psd permit applicants and permitting officials may disregard these provisions of the act.fed.reg.
a few additional points bear mentioning.the solicitor general conjectures that epa might eventually alter its longstanding interpretation of potential to emit in order to reduce the number of sources required to have permits at the statutory thresholds.but neither he nor the agency has given us any reason to believe that there exists a plausible reading of potential to emit that epa would willingly adopt and that would eliminate the unreasonableness of epa interpretation.nor have we been given any information about the ability of other possible streamlining techniques alluded to by epa such as general or electronic permitting to reduce the administrability problems identified above and in any event,none of those techniques would address the more fundamental problem of epa claiming regulatory authority over millions of small entities that it acknowledges the act does not seek to regulate.finally,the solicitor general suggests that the incompatibility of greenhouse gases with the psd program and title v results chiefly from the inclusion of carbon dioxide in the aggregate pollutant defined by epa.we decide these cases on the basis of the pollutant greenhouse gases as epa has defined and regulated it,and we express no view on how our analysis might change were epa to define it differently.
epa first asked the public,in a notice of proposed rulemaking,to comment on how the agency should respond to massachusetts.in doing so,it explained that regulating emissions from motor vehicles could have consequences for stationary sources.under epa view,once greenhouse gases became regulated under any part of the act,the psd and title v permitting requirements would apply to all stationary sources with the potential to emit greenhouse gases in excess of the statutory thresholds tons per year under title v,and or tons per year under the psd program depending on the type of source.fed.reg.because emissions tend to be orders of magnitude greater than emissions of conventional pollutants,epa projected that numerous small sources not previously regulated under the act would be swept into the psd program and title v,including smaller industrial sources,large office and residential buildings,hotels,large retail establishments,and similar facilities.at.the agency warned that this would constitute an unprecedented expansion of epa authority that would have a profound effect on virtually every sector of the economy and touch every household in the land,yet still be relatively ineffective at reducing greenhouse gas concentrations.at.
the court answers by pointing out that regulation at the tpy threshold would produce absurd results,refusing to read the statute as compelling such results,and consequently interpreting the phrase any air pollutant as containing an implicit exception for greenhouse gases.emphasis added.put differently,the court reads the statute as defining major emitting facility to mean stationary sources that have the potential to emit two hundred fifty tons per year or more of any air pollutant except for those air pollutants,such as carbon dioxide,with respect to which regulation at that threshold would be impractical or absurd or would sweep in smaller sources that congress did not mean to cover.see ante,at t here is no insuperable textual barrier to epa interpreting any air pollutant in the permitting triggers of psd and title v to encompass only pollutants emitted in quantities that enable them to be sensibly regulated at the statutory thresholds,and to exclude those atypical pollutants that,like greenhouse gases,are emitted in such vast quantities that their inclusion would radically transform those programs and render them unworkable as written.
to sum up we hold that epa exceeded its statutory authority when it interpreted the clean air act to require psd and title v permitting for stationary sources based on their emissions.specifically,the agency may not treat greenhouse gases as a pollutant for purposes of defining a major emitting facility or a modification thereof in the psd context or a major source in the title v context.to the extent its regulations purport to do so,they are invalid.epa may,however,continue to treat greenhouse gases as a pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter for purposes of requiring bact for anyway sources.the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
but i do not agree with the court that the only way to avoid an absurd or otherwise impermissible result in these cases is to create an atextual greenhouse gas exception to the phrase any air pollutant.after all,the word any makes an earlier appearance in the definitional provision,which defines major emitting facility to mean any source with the potential to emit two hundred and fifty tons per year or more of any air pollutant.emphasis added.as a linguistic matter,one can just as easily read an implicit exception for greenhouse gas emissions into the phrase any source as into the phrase any air pollutant.and given the purposes of the psd program and the act as a whole,as well as the specific roles of the different parts of the statutory definition,finding flexibility in any source is far more sensible than the court route of finding it in any air pollutant.
i also agree with the court point that a generic reference to air pollutants in the clean air act need not encompass every substance falling within the definition that we construed in massachusetts,g.see ante,at.as the court notes,the epa has interpreted the phrase any air pollutant,which is used several times in the act,as limited to air pollutants for which epa has promulgated new source performance standards in the portion of the act dealing with those standards,as limited to air pollutants in the part of the act concerned with deleterious effects on visibility,and as limited to pollutants for which the area is designated nonattainment in the part of the act aimed at regions that fail to attain air quality standards.ibid.
epa thought that despite the foregoing problems,it could make its interpretation reasonable by adjusting the levels at which a source emissions would oblige it to undergo psd and title v permitting.although the act,in no uncertain terms,requires permits for sources with the potential to emit more than or tons per year of a relevant pollutant,epa in its tailoring rule wrote a new threshold of tons per year for greenhouse gases.since the court of appeals thought the statute unambiguously made greenhouse gases capable of triggering psd and title v,it held that petitioners lacked article iii standing to challenge the tailoring rule because that rule did not injure petitioners but merely relaxed the statutory requirements.because we,however,hold that epa interpretation of the triggers was not compelled,and because epa has essentially admitted that its interpretation would be unreasonable without tailoring,we consider the validity of the tailoring rule.
i agree with the court holding that stationary sources that are subject to the psd program because they emit other pollutants in quantities above the statutory threshold those facilities that the court refers to as anyway sources must meet the best available control technology requirement of a with respect to greenhouse gas emissions.i therefore join part of the court opinion.but as for the court holding that the epa can not interpret the language at issue here to cover facilities that emit more than tpy of greenhouse gases by virtue of those emissions,i respectfully dissent.
the court decision to read greenhouse gases out of the psd program drains the act of its flexibility and chips away at our decision in massachusetts.what sense does it make to read the act as generally granting the epa the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and then to read it as denying that power with respect to the programs for large stationary sources at issue here it is anomalous to read the act to require the epa to regulate air pollutants that pose previously unforeseen threats to human health and welfare where tons per year is a sensible regulatory line but not where,by chemical or regulatory happenstance,a higher line must be drawn.and it is anomalous to read an unwritten exception into the more important phrase of the statutory definition any air pollutant when a similar unwritten exception to less important language the particular number used by the statute will do just as well.the implicit exception preferred by the court produces all of these anomalies,while the exception i propose creates none of them.
the clean air act imposes permitting requirements on stationary sources,such as factories and powerplants.the act prevention of significant deterioration psd provisions make it unlawful to construct or modify a major emitting facility in any area to which the psd program applies without a permit.a,c.a major emitting facility is a stationary source with the potential to emit tons per year of any air pollutant or tons per year for certain types of sources.facilities seeking to qualify for a psd permit must,inter alia,comply with emissions limitations that reflect the best available control technology bact for each pollutant subject to regulation under the act.a.in addition,title v of the act makes it unlawful to operate any major source,wherever located,without a permit.a.a major source is a stationary source with the potential to emit tons per year of any air pollutant.b,j.
during the course of this litigation,several possible limiting constructions for the psd trigger have been proposed.judge kavanaugh argued below that it would be plausible for epa to read any air pollutant in the psd context as limited to the six naaqs pollutants.see coalition for responsible regulation,epa,cadc,app,wl,opinion dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc.some petitioners make a slightly different argument that because psd permitting is required only for major emitting facilities in any area to which the psd program applies,a,the relevant pollutants are only those naaqs pollutants for which the area in question is designated attainment or unclassifiable.that approach would bring epa interpretation of the psd trigger in line with its longstanding interpretation of the permitting requirements for nonattainment areas.others maintain that any air pollutant in the psd provision should be limited to air pollutants with localized effects on air quality.we do not foreclose epa or the courts from considering those constructions in the future,but we need not do so today.
the text of the bact provision is far less than the text of the psd and title v permitting triggers.it states that bact is required for each pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter the entire act,a,a phrase that as the circuit wrote years ago would not seem readily susceptible of misinterpretation.alabama power costle.whereas the dubious breadth of any air pollutant in the permitting triggers suggests a role for agency judgment in identifying the subset of pollutants covered by the particular regulatory program at issue,the more specific phrasing of the bact provision suggests that the necessary judgment has already been made by congress.the wider statutory context likewise does not suggest that the bact provision can bear a narrowing construction there is no indication that the act elsewhere uses,or that epa has interpreted,each pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter to mean anything other than what it says.
numerous parties,including several states,filed petitions for review in the circuit under b,challenging epa actions.the court of appeals dismissed some of the petitions for lack of jurisdiction and denied the remainder.coalition for responsible regulation,epa,per curiam.first,it upheld the endangerment finding and tailpipe rule,at.next,it held that epa interpretation of the psd permitting requirement as applying to any regulated air pollutant,including greenhouse gases,was compelled by the statute.at.the court also found it crystal clear that psd permittees must install bact for greenhouse gases.at.because it deemed petitioners arguments about the psd program insufficiently applicable to title v,it held they had forfeited any challenges to epa greenhouse interpretation of title at.finally,it held that petitioners were without article iii standing to challenge epa efforts to limit the reach of the psd program and title v through the triggering and tailoring rules,at.the court denied rehearing en banc,with judges brown and kavanaugh each dissenting,app,wl.
massachusetts does not strip epa of authority to exclude greenhouse gases from the class of regulable air pollutants under other parts of the act where their inclusion would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme.the definition to which the court gave a sweeping and capacious interpretation,at,is not a command to regulate,but a description of the universe of substances epa may consider regulating under the act operative provisions.massachusetts does not foreclose the agency use of statutory context to infer that certain of the act provisions use air pollutant to denote not every conceivable airborne substance,but only those that may sensibly be encompassed within the particular regulatory program.as certain amici felicitously put it,while massachusetts rejected epa categorical contention that greenhouse gases could not be air pollutants for any purposes of the act,it did not embrace epa current,equally categorical position that greenhouse gases must be air pollutants for all purposes regardless of the statutory context.brief for administrative law professors et as amici curiae.
