we granted certiorari,limited to the first question presented whether a court should apply chevron to an agency determination of its own jurisdiction.pet.for cert.in,
as this case turns on the scope of the doctrine enshrined in chevron,we begin with a description of that case formulation.when a court reviews an agency construction of the statute which it administers,it is confronted with two questions.at.first,applying the ordinary tools of statutory construction,the court must determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.at.but if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.at.
where we differ from the dissent is in its apparent rejection of the theorem that the whole includes all of its parts its view that a general conferral of rulemaking authority does not validate rules for all the matters the agency is charged with administering.rather,the dissent proposes that even when general rulemaking authority is clear,every agency rule must be subjected to a de novo judicial determination of whether the particular issue was committed to agency discretion.it offers no standards at all to guide this hunt for congressional intent that is to say,for evidence of congressional intent more specific than the conferral of general rulemaking authority.it would simply punt that question back to the court of appeals,presumably for application of some sort of test which is really,of course,not a test at all but an invitation to make an ad hoc judgment regarding congressional intent.thirteen courts of appeals applying a test would render the binding effect of agency rules unpredictable and destroy the whole stabilizing purpose of chevron.the excessive agency power that the dissent fears would be replaced by chaos.there is no need to wade into these murky waters.it suffices to decide this case that the preconditions to deference under chevron are satisfied because congress has unambiguously vested the fcc with general authority to administer the communications act through rulemaking and adjudication,and the agency interpretation at issue was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.
the communications act of,as amended,requires state or local governments to act on siting applications for wireless facilities within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed.c b ii.relying on its broad authority to implement the communications act,see b,the federal communications commission fcc issued a declaratory ruling concluding that the phrase reasonable period of time is presumptively but rebuttably days to process an application to place a new antenna on an existing tower and days to process all other applications.the cities of arlington and san antonio,texas,sought review of the declaratory ruling in the fifth circuit.they argued that the commission lacked authority to interpret c b limitations.the court of appeals,relying on circuit precedent holding that chevron natural resources defense council,applies to an agency interpretation of its own statutory jurisdiction,applied chevron to that question.finding the statute ambiguous,it upheld as a permissible construction of the statute the fcc view that b broad grant of regulatory authority empowered it to administer c b.
held courts must apply the chevron framework to an agency interpretation of a statutory ambiguity that concerns the scope of the agency statutory authority,its jurisdiction.
the court states that the question is whether a court must defer under chevron to an agency interpretation of a statutory ambiguity that concerns the scope of the agency statutory authority that is,its jurisdiction.ante,at.that is fine until the parenthetical.the parties,amici,and court below too often use the term jurisdiction imprecisely,which leads the court to misunderstand the argument it must confront.that argument is not that there exist two distinct classes of agency interpretations,some big,important ones that define the agency jurisdiction,and other humdrum,ones that are simply applications of jurisdiction the agency plainly has.ibid.the argument is instead that a court should not defer to an agency on whether congress has granted the agency interpretive authority over the statutory ambiguity at issue.
the question here is whether a court must defer under chevron to an agency interpretation of a statutory ambiguity that concerns the scope of the agency statutory authority that is,its jurisdiction.the argument against deference rests on the premise that there exist two distinct classes of agency interpretations some interpretations the big,important ones,presumably define the agency jurisdiction.others humdrum,stuff are simply applications of jurisdiction the agency plainly has.that premise is false,because the distinction between jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional interpretations is a mirage.no matter how it is framed,the question a court faces when confronted with an agency interpretation of a statute it administers is always,simply,whether the agency has stayed within the bounds of its statutory authority.
e united states mead,requires that,for chevron deference to apply,the agency must have received congressional authority to determine the particular matter at issue in the particular manner adopted.but mead denied chevron deference to action,by an agency with rulemaking authority,that was not rulemaking.there is no case in which a general conferral of rulemaking or adjudicative authority has been held insufficient to support chevron deference for an exercise of that authority within the agency substantive field.a general conferral of rulemaking authority validates rules for all the matters the agency is charged with administering.it suffices to decide this case that the preconditions to deference under chevron are satisfied because congress has unambiguously vested the fcc with general authority to administer the communications act through rulemaking and adjudication,and the agency interpretation at issue was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.
by the same logic,even when congress provides interpretive authority to a single agency,a court must decide if the ambiguity the agency has purported to interpret with the force of law is one to which the congressional delegation extends.a general delegation to the agency to administer the statute will often suffice to satisfy the court that congress has delegated interpretive authority over the ambiguity at issue.but if congress has exempted particular provisions from that authority,that exemption must be respected,and the determination whether congress has done so is for the courts alone.
relying on circuit precedent,the court of appeals held that the chevron framework applied to the threshold question whether the fcc possessed statutory authority to adopt the and timeframes,citing texas united states.applying chevron,the court of appeals found c a effect on the fcc authority to administer c b limitations ambiguous,at,and held that the fcc interpretation of its statutory authority was a permissible construction of the statute,at.on the merits,the court upheld the presumptive and deadlines as a permissible construction of c b ii and v entitled to chevron deference.at.
but before a court may grant such deference,it must on its own decide whether congress the branch vested with lawmaking authority under the constitution has in fact delegated to the agency lawmaking power over the ambiguity at issue.see ante,at breyer,concurring in part and concurring in judgment the question whether congress has delegated to an agency the authority to provide an interpretation that carries the force of law is for the judge to answer independently.agencies are creatures of congress an agency literally has no power to act unless and until congress confers power upon it.louisiana pub.serv.comm fcc.whether congress has conferred such power is the relevant question of law that must be answered before affording chevron deference.
the case before us offers an example.the relevant statutory provision requires state or local governments to act on wireless siting applications within a reasonable period of time after a wireless service provider files such a request.c b ii.the federal communications commission fcc argued that this provision granted it a degree of leeway in determining the amount of time that is reasonable.many factors favor the agency view the language of the telecommunications act grants the fcc broad authority including rulemaking authority to administer the act the words are ambiguous the provision concerns an interstitial administrative matter,in respect to which the agency expertise could have an important role to play and the matter,in context,is complex,likely making the agency expertise useful in helping to answer the reasonableness question that the statute poses.see creating the fcc b providing rulemaking authority national cable telecommunications brand x internet services,acknowledging the fcc authority to administer the act.
gonzales oregon,is in the same line of precedent.in that case,as here,deference turned on whether a congressional delegation of interpretive authority reached a particular statutory ambiguity.the attorney general claimed chevron deference for his interpretation of the phrase legitimate medical purpose in the controlled substances act csa to exclude the prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances for the purpose of assisting suicide,at.no one disputed that legitimate medical purpose was ambiguous in the relevant sense.at.nor did any justice dispute that the attorney general had been granted the power in the csa to promulgate rules with the force of law.see,at scalia,dissenting.nevertheless,the court explained,chevron deference is not accorded merely because the statute is ambiguous and an administrative official is involved.at.the regulation advancing the interpretation,we said,must be promulgated pursuant to authority congress has delegated to the official.ibid.citing mead,supra,at.
my disagreement with the court is fundamental.it is also easily expressed a court should not defer to an agency until the court decides,on its own,that the agency is entitled to deference.courts defer to an agency interpretation of law when and because congress has conferred on the agency interpretive authority over the question at issue.an agency can not exercise interpretive authority until it has it the question whether an agency enjoys that authority must be decided by a court,without deference to the agency.
b when a court reviews an agency interpretation of a statute it administers,the question is always,simply,whether the agency has stayed within the bounds of its statutory authority.there is no distinction between an agency jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional interpretations.the line is meaningful in the judicial context because congress has the power to tell the courts what classes of cases they may decide that is,to define their jurisdiction but not to prescribe how they decide those cases.but for agencies charged with administering congressional statutes,both their power to act and how they are to act is authoritatively prescribed by congress,so that when they act improperly,no less than when they act beyond their jurisdiction,what they do is ultra vires.because the question is always whether the agency has gone beyond what congress has permitted it to do,there is no principled basis for carving out an arbitrary subset of jurisdictional questions from the chevron framework.see,national cable telecommunications,gulf power.
as for judicial oversight,agencies enjoy broad power to construe statutory provisions over which they have been given interpretive authority.in chevron natural resources defense council,we established a test for reviewing an agency construction of the statute which it administers.if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,we said,that is the end of the matter.ibid.a contrary agency interpretation must give way.but if congress has not expressed a specific intent,a court is bound to defer to any permissible construction of the statute,even if that is not the reading the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding.at,and.
in mead,we again made clear that the category of interpretative choices to which chevron deference applies is defined by congressional intent,at.chevron deference,we said,rests on a recognition that congress has delegated to an agency the interpretive authority to implement a particular provision or answer a particular question.ibid.quoting chevron,at.an agency interpretation of a particular statutory provision thus qualifies for chevron deference only when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was in the exercise of that authority.at.
