indeed,in cases like wang,the problem is broader under the statute most natural reading,a new qualified sponsor will hardly ever exist at the moment the petition is to be converted.section h,to be sure,does not explicitly identify that point in time.but h specifies the date on which a derivative beneficiary is deemed to have either aged out or not it is the date on which an immigrant visa number became available for the alien parent.see h a b.because that statutory aging out is the one and only thing that triggers automatic conversion for eligible aliens,the date of conversion is best viewed as the same.that reading,moreover,comports with the automatic conversion regulation on which congress drew in enacting the cspa,see supra,at the rule authorizes conversions upon or as of the date of the relevant change in the alien status including turning regardless when uscis may receive notice of the change.cfr i but post,at sotomayor,dissenting wrongly stating that under that rule conversion occurs upon the agency receipt of proof of the change.but on that date,no new petitioner will be ready to step into the old one shoes if such a substitution is needed to fit an beneficiary into a different category.the beneficiary parent,on the day a visa number became available,can not yet be an lpr or citizen by definition,she has just become eligible to apply for a visa,and faces a wait of at least several months before she can sponsor an alien herself.nor,except in a trivial number of cases,is any hitherto unidentified person likely to have a legally recognized relationship to the alien.so if an beneficiary has lost his qualifying connection to the original petitioner,no conversion to an appropriate category can take place at the requisite time.as long as immigration law demands some valid sponsor,h can not give such an alien the designated relief.
the plurality points to nothing in the plain meaning of conversion that supports this distinction.it instead argues that a conversion can not entail a change to the identity of a petition sponsor because that is the exclusive way immigration law used the term when congress enacted the cspa.ante,at.but immigration law has long allowed petitions to be converted from one category to another in contexts where doing so requires changing the sponsor identity.in,for example,the secretary of homeland security promulgated a regulatory provision entitled automatic conversion of preference classification,cfr i iv,which allows the automatic conversion of a petition filed by a citizen on behalf of her spouse to a widower petition if the citizen dies before the petition is approved.that conversion requires changing the sponsor from the citizen to the widower himself.the fact that the agency used the word conversion to refer to a process in which the petition sponsor was changed,just a few years after h was enacted,strongly suggests that the term did not have the exclusive meaning that the plurality suggests.similarly,a d i iii,a provision enacted two years before h,see victims of trafficking and violence protection act of,stat,provides that a petition filed by a battered spouse on behalf of her child shall be considered a filed by the child herself if the child ages out a conversion that obviously requires changing the identity of the sponsor from the battered spouse to the child.and h confirms that such are entitled to h automatic conversion remedy.the plurality never explains how it can be mandatory to convert the identity of the sponsors in these contexts yet impermissible to convert the sponsors of the petitions at issue here an understanding that is especially implausible in light of congress command that such petitions shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category.h.
the immigration and nationality act permits qualifying citizens and lawful permanent residents lprs to petition for certain family members to obtain immigrant visas.a sponsored individual,known as the principal beneficiary,is placed into a family preference category based on his relationship with the petitioner.a.the principal beneficiary spouse and minor children in turn qualify as derivative beneficiaries,entitled to the same status and order of consideration as the principal.d.the beneficiaries then become eligible to apply for visas in order of priority date that is,the date a petition was filed.e.because the immigration process often takes years or decades to complete,a child seeking to immigrate may age out reach adulthood and lose her immigration status before she reaches the front of the visa queue.the child status protection act cspa sets forth a remedy in that circumstance,providing that i f the age of an alien is determined to be years of age or older,notwithstanding certain allowances for bureaucratic delay,h,the alien petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.h.
congress used the word conversion even without the modifier automatic in the identical way in two other sections of the cspa.see law siegel,slip,at w ords repeated in different parts of the same statute generally have the same meaning section refers to occasions on which,by virtue of the regulation,a petition converted from to the immediate relative category because of the sponsor parent naturalization,or from the to the box because of the beneficiary divorce.f.then,in,congress authorized an additional conversion of the same nature it directed that when an lpr naturalizes,the petition he has filed for his adult son or daughter shall be converted,unless the beneficiary objects,from the to the compartment again with the original priority date unchanged.k.that mechanism itself underscores the otherwise mechanical nature of the conversion.once again,in those cases,all that is involved is a recategorization moving the same petition,filed by the same petitioner,from one preference classification to another,so as to reflect a change in either the alien or his sponsor status.in the rest of the cspa,as in the prior immigration regulation,that is what conversion means.
the board rejected that argument.it explained that the language of h does not expressly state which petitions qualify for automatic conversion and retention of priority dates.at.given that ambiguity,the bia looked to the recognized meaning of the phrase automatic conversion in immigration statutes and regulations which it presume d congress understood when enacting the cspa,at.historically,the bia showed,that language applied only when a petition could move seamlessly from one family preference category to another not when a new sponsor was needed to fit a beneficiary into a different category,at.some aliens petitions could accomplish that maneuver,because the alien had a qualifying relationship with the original sponsor,and continued to do so upon aging out in that event,the board held,h ensured that the alien would retain his original priority date.see,at.but the petition filed by wang sister could not automatically be converted in that way because wang daughter never had a qualifying relationship with the sponsor n o category exists for the niece of a united states citizen.at.that is why wang himself had to file a new petition on his daughter behalf once she aged out and could no longer ride on his sibling status.the board saw no evidence that congress meant to expand the use of the concept of automatic conversion to reach such a case,at.and the board thought such an expansion unwarranted because it would allow aliens like wang daughter,who lacked any independent entitlement to a visa during the years her father spent standing on the queue,to cut in line ahead of others awaiting visas in other preference categories.at.
and a further problem follows this one concerning the date of automatic conversion.the respondents need that date to come at a time when the derivative beneficiaries parents the substitute petitioners are already living in the united states as lprs otherwise,the petitions could not qualify for the box.in an attempt to make that possible,the respondents propose that conversion be viewed as taking place when the derivative beneficiary visa application is adjudicated.brief for respondents.but as we have again demonstrated,the statute is best read as establishing a different date that on which an immigrant visa number became available for the alien parent when,by definition,the parent is not yet an lpr.h see supra,at.that is the moment when a derivative ages out,which is the single change conversion reflects.by contrast,the respondents suggested date has no connection to that metamorphosis the date of adjudication is merely when an immigration official later discovers that a child has turned.and that date is itself fortuitous,reflecting no more than when an immigration officer got around to reviewing a visa application the possibility of conversion would thus depend on bureaucratic vagaries attending the visa process.so the respondents mistaken view of the timing of conversion is another from their argument.
the chief justice,joined by justice scalia,agreed that the bia interpretation was reasonable,but not because an agency has authority to resolve direct conflicts within a statute.there is no conflict or internal tension in h.the first clause of the provision defines the persons potentially affected,but does not grant anything to anyone.the particular benefit provided by the statute automatic conversion and retention of priority date is found exclusively in the second clause,and that relief requires,at minimum,that an beneficiary have his own eligible sponsor who is committed to providing financial support for the beneficiary.beyond that,congress did not speak clearly to which petitions can be automatically converted.the bia reasonable interpretation of h is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the statutory terms,with the established meaning of automatic conversion in immigration law,and with the structure of the immigration system.
still,the respondents view of the timing of conversion is better than the dissent.as an initial matter,the dissent objection to assessing conversion as of the date a visa becomes available hinges on an imaginary difficulty.that approach,the dissent complains,can not be right because that date always occurs before the point at which the child is determined to have.post,at.well,yes.the date a visa becomes available is,under the statute,the date an alien ages out or not and that status change of course occurs before an immigration official,reviewing a visa application,finds that it has done so.but what of it when an official determines that an alien was no longer a child on the date a visa became available,he also assesses whether automatic conversion was available to the alien as of that prior date.in other words,here as elsewhere in immigration law,conversion occurs or not upon the date of the relevant status change and no other.see supra,at.and once that is understood,the supposed difficulties the dissent throws up all melt away.at the time of the status change,petitions can be converted without further contingencies,decisions,or delays,whereas no other petitions can.but post,at,countering,irrelevantly,that after an petition is automatically converted,additional steps remain in the immigration process.and immigration officials later reviewing visa applications know that fact,and can treat the different classes of beneficiaries accordingly.
begin by reading the statute from the top the part favoring the respondents.section h first clause if the age of an alien is determined under paragraph to be years of age or older for the purposes of subsections a a and d states a condition that every beneficiary of a preference petition satisfies.that is because all those beneficiaries have had their ages determined under paragraph and have come up wanting recall that the age formula of h applies to each alien child who originally qualified under subsections a a and d as the principal beneficiary of an petition or the derivative beneficiary of any family preference petition.on its own,then,h opening clause encompasses the respondents sons and daughters,along with every other beneficiary of a family preference petition now on the wrong side of.if the next phrase said something like the alien shall be treated as though still a minor much as the cspa did to ensure citizens children,qualifying as immediate relatives,would stay forever young,see supra,at,all those beneficiaries would prevail in this case.
if the age of an alien is determined under paragraph to be years of age or older for the purposes of subsections a a and d of this section,the alien petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.h.
if the age of an alien is determined under paragraph to be years of age or older for the purposes of subsections a a and d of this section,the alien petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.
faced with this fact,the plurality falls back to the position that automatic conversion must merely be viewed as having occurred as of th e date when a parent visa becomes available,although the actual assess ment of the conversion will necessarily occur at some future point in time.ante,at.that approach,however,introduces precisely the kind of additional decisions,contingencies,and delays that the plurality regards as inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of automatic,ante,at.for even under the plurality view,automatic conversion can not actually be assesse d until and unless the child decides to apply for a visa and officials assessing the child application deem her to have aged out events which may themselves be contingent on the child parent first filing her own successful visa application,see ante,at.the far simpler approach is for conversion to occur automatically upon the most logical moment suggested by the statute the moment when uscis confirms that an appropriate category exists,h.indeed,the plurality fails to explain why this can not be the proper predicate it simply dismisses such an approach as supported only by a resolve to grant relief to every possible beneficiary.ante,at.but that criticism is revealing the resolve the plurality maligns is congress own,for it is congress that expressly provided,in the eligibility clause,for beneficiaries in all five categories to be granted relief.
if the age of an alien is determined under the formula specified in paragraph to be years of age or older for the purpos e of d of this section,the alien petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.
yet there is more because even after substituting a new petitioner and delaying the conversion date in a way the statute does not contemplate,the respondents must propose yet further fixes to make automatic conversion work for their sons and daughters.the respondents next problem is that even on the conversion date they propose,most of them and other derivatives parents were not yet lprs,and so could not possibly be sponsors.in the ordinary course,principal and derivative beneficiaries living abroad apply for their visas at the same time and go to the consulate together for interviews.see supra,at.and even if the parent is approved first,that alone does not make her an lpr she still must come to this country,demonstrate her continued eligibility,and pass an inspection.see ibid.thus,the respondents must recommend changes to the visa process to get the timing to work essentially,administrative juggling to hold off the derivative beneficiary visa adjudication until his parent has become an lpr.in particular,they suggest that the consular official defer the derivative interview,or that the official nominally reject the application and then instruct the derivative to reapply after the principal beneficiary immigrates.brief for respondents.but the need for that choreography which,in any event,few if any of the respondents conformed to renders the conversion process only less automatic,because now it requires special intervention,purposeful delay,and deviation from standard administrative practice.conversion has become not a machine that would go of itself,but a process painstakingly managed.
if the age of an alien is determined under section h to be years of age or older for the purposes of subsections a a and d of this section,the alien petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.h.
