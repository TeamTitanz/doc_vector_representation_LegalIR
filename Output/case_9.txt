the america invents act creates an agency procedure called inter partes review that allows a third party to ask the patent and trademark office to reexamine the claims in an patent and to cancel any claim that the agency finds to be unpatentable in light of prior art.the act,as relevant here,provides that the patent office decision whether to institute an inter partes review shall be final and,d,and grants the patent office authority to issue regulations establishing and governing inter partes review,a.a patent office regulation issued pursuant to that authority provides that,during inter partes review,a patent claim shall be given its broadest reasonable construction in light of the specification of the patent in which it appears.cfr b.
in,garmin international,and garmin usa,sought inter partes review of all claims of a patent held by petitioner cuozzo speed technologies,llc,asserting,among other things,that claim was obvious in light of three prior patents.the patent office agreed to review claim.it also decided to reexamine claims and on that same ground because it determined those claims to be logically linked to the obviousness challenge to claim.the patent office,through its patent trial and appeal board,concluded that the claims were obvious in light of prior art,denied for reasons of futility cuozzo motion to amend the claims,and canceled all three claims.
nevertheless,in light of d own text and the presumption favoring review,we emphasize that our interpretation applies where the grounds for attacking the decision to institute inter partes review consist of questions that are closely tied to the application and interpretation of statutes related to the patent office decision to initiate inter partes review.see d barring appeals of determinations to initiate an inter partes review under this section emphasis added.this means that we need not,and do not,decide the precise effect of d on appeals that implicate constitutional questions,that depend on other less closely related statutes,or that present other questions of interpretation that reach,in terms of scope and impact,well beyond this section.johnson robison,statute precluding review of any question of law or fact under any law administered by the veterans administration does not bar review of constitutional challenges emphasis deleted and internal quotation marks omitted traynor turnage,that same statute does not bar review of decisions made under different statutes enacted at other times.thus,contrary to the dissent suggestion,we do not categorically preclude review of a final decision where a petition fails to give sufficient notice such that there is a due process problem with the entire proceeding,nor does our interpretation enable the agency to act outside its statutory limits by,for example,canceling a patent claim for indefiniteness under in inter partes review.post,at.such shenanigans may be properly reviewable in the context of and under the administrative procedure act,which enables reviewing courts to set aside agency action that is contrary to constitutional right,in excess of statutory jurisdiction,or arbitrary and capricious.compare post,at,with a d.
by contrast,where a patent holder merely challenges the patent office determin ation that the information presented in the petition shows that there is a reasonable likelihood of success with respect to at least of the claims challenged,a,or where a patent holder grounds its claim in a statute closely related to that decision to institute inter partes review,d bars judicial review.in this case,cuozzo claim that garmin petition was not pleaded with particularity under is little more than a challenge to the patent office conclusion,under a,that the information presented in the petition warranted review.united states williams,a complaint about the quality or adequacy of the evidence can always be recast as a complaint that the presentation was incomplete or misleading we therefore conclude that d bars cuozzo efforts to attack the patent office determination to institute inter partes review in this case.
this is a far easier case than lindahl.there is no question that the statute now before us can naturally perhaps most naturally be read to permit judicial review of issues bearing on the patent office institution of inter partes review.section d reads the determination by the director whether to institute an inter partes review under this section shall be final and nonappealable.unlike the statutes we addressed in lindahl including the one we found to permit review,d does not say that an institution decision is not subject to review.instead,it makes the institution decision nonappealable.this is fairly interpreted to bar only an appeal from the institution decision itself,while allowing review of institutionrelated issues in an appeal from the patent office final written decision at the end of the proceeding.see.our cases have used the term nonappealable in just this way to refer to matters that are not immediately or independently appealable,but which are subject to review at a later point thus,while the decision to institute inter partes review is final and nonappealable in the sense that a court can not stop the proceeding from going forward the question whether it was lawful to institute review will not escape judicial scrutiny.this approach is consistent with the normal rule that a party may challenge earlier agency rulings that are themselves not directly reviewable when seeking review of a final,appealable decision.and it strikes a sensible balance the patent office may proceed unimpeded with the inter partes review process which must normally be completed within one year,see a,but it will be held to account for its compliance with the law at the end of the day.
the dissent,like the panel dissent in the court of appeals,would limit the scope of the no appeal provision to interlocutory appeals,leaving a court free to review the initial decision to institute review in the context of the agency final decision.post,at,alito,concurring in part and dissenting in part,at newman,dissenting.we can not accept this interpretation.it reads into the provision a limitation to interlocutory decisions that the language nowhere mentions and that is unnecessary.the administrative procedure act already limits review to final agency decisions.the patent office decision to initiate inter partes review is preliminary,not final.ibid.and the agency decision to deny a petition is a matter committed to the patent office discretion.see a a no mandate to institute review see also post,at,and.so,read as limited to such preliminary and discretionary decisions,the no appeal provision would seem superfluous.the dissent also suggests that its approach is a familiar practice,consistent with other areas of law.post,at.but the kind of initial determination at issue here that there is a reasonable likelihood that the claims are unpatentable on the grounds asserted is akin to decisions which,in other contexts,we have held to be unreviewable.see kaley united states,slip,at the grand jury gets to say without any review,oversight,or whether probable cause exists to think that a person committed a crime.
the statute imposes other restrictions as well.a petition for inter partes review may be considered only if the petition satisfies certain requirements,including as relevant here that the petition identif y,in writing and with particularity,each claim challenged,the grounds on which the challenge to each claim is based,and the evidence that supports the grounds for the challenge to each claim.a.additionally,inter partes review may not be instituted if the party challenging the patent previously filed a civil action challenging the patent validity or was sued for infringing the patent more than a year before seeking inter partes review.a,b.finally,the patent office may not institute inter partes review unless the director of the patent office determines that the information presented in the challenger petition and any response by the patent owner shows that there is a reasonable likelihood that the petitioner would prevail with respect to at least of the claims challenged in the petition.a.
we recognize the strong presumption in favor of judicial review that we apply when we interpret statutes,including statutes that may limit or preclude review.mach mining,llc eeoc,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.this presumption,however,may be overcome by clear and convincing indications,drawn from specific language,specific legislative history,and inferences of intent drawn from the statutory scheme as a whole,that congress intended to bar review.block community nutrition institute.that standard is met here.the dissent disagrees,and it points to lindahl office of personnel management,to support its view that,in light of this presumption,d should be read to permit judicial review of any issue bearing on the patent office preliminary decision to institute inter partes review.see post,at.lindahl is a case about the judicial review of disability determinations for federal employees.we explained that a statute directing the office of personnel management to determine questions of disability,and making those decisions final,conclusive,and not subject to review,barred a court from revisiting the factual underpinnings of disability determinations though it permitted courts to consider claims alleging,for example,that the office of personnel management substantial ly depart ed from important procedural rights.at.thus,lindahl interpretation of that statute preserved the agency primacy over its core statutory function in accord with congress intent.our interpretation of the no appeal provision here has the same effect.congress has told the patent office to determine whether inter partes review should proceed,and it has made the agency decision final and nonappealable.d.our conclusion that courts may not revisit this initial determination gives effect to this statutory command.moreover,lindahl conclusion was consistent with prior judicial practice in respect to those factual agency determinations,and legislative history strongly suggest ed that congress intended to preserve this prior practice,at.these features,as explained above,also support our interpretation the text of the no appeal provision,along with its place in the overall statutory scheme,its role alongside the administrative procedure act,the prior interpretation of similar patent statutes,and congress purpose in crafting inter partes review,all point in favor of precluding review of the patent office institution decisions.
in this case,the patent office instituted inter partes review of claims and of cuozzo patent based on prior art that the challenger petition did not cite with respect to those claims.after trial,the patent office issued a final written decision holding those claims unpatentable,and cuozzo appealed that decision to the federal circuit.in its appeal,cuozzo argued among other things that the patent office had violated the requirement that a petition for inter partes review may be considered only if the petition identifies the grounds on which the challenge to each claim is based,and the evidence that supports the grounds for the challenge,with particularity.a.
cuozzo appealed to the federal circuit.cuozzo claimed that the patent office improperly instituted inter partes review with respect to claims and,and it alleged that the board improperly used the broadest reasonable construction standard to interpret the claims rather than the standard used by courts,which gives claims their ordinary meaning as understood by a person of skill in the art,phillips awh.the federal circuit rejected both arguments.it reasoned that d made the patent office decision to institute inter partes review nonappealable,and it concluded that the patent office regulation was a reasonable exercise of the agency rulemaking authority.
an inventor obtains a patent by applying to the patent office.a patent examiner with expertise in the relevant field reviews an applicant patent claims,considers the prior art,and determines whether each claim meets the applicable patent law requirements.see.then,the examiner accepts a claim,or rejects it and explains why.see a.
if the examiner rejects a claim,the applicant can resubmit a narrowed or otherwise modified claim,which the examiner will consider anew,measuring the new claim against the same patent law requirements.if the examiner rejects the new claim,the inventor typically has yet another chance to respond with yet another amended claim.ultimately,the patent office makes a final decision allowing or rejecting the application.the applicant may seek judicial review of any final rejection.see a.
for several decades,the patent office has also possessed the authority to reexamine and perhaps cancel a patent claim that it had previously allowed.in,for example,congress enacted a statute providing for ex parte reexamination.act to amend the patent and trademark laws,et.that statute which remains in effect gives a ny person at any time the right to file a request for reexamination on the basis of certain prior art bearing on the patentability of an patent.a.if the patent office concludes that the cited prior art raises a substantial new question of patentability,the agency can reexamine the patent.a.and that reexamination can lead the patent office to cancel the patent or some of its claims.alternatively,the director of the patent office can,on her own initiative,trigger such a proceeding.ibid.and,as with examination,the patent holder can seek judicial review of an adverse final decision.
the court also observes that the inter partes review appeal provision,limit s appellate review to the final written decision.ante,at.the majority reads too much into this provision.section provides simply that a party dissatisfied with the final written decision may appeal the decision.the statute does not restrict the issues that may be raised in such an appeal.as the patent office once explained before having a change of heart,the plain language of the statutory text recognizes a right of judicial review for any party dissatisfied by the patent office ultimate written decision,and n othing in the statutory scheme limits the reasons that a party might be so dissatisfied.memorandum of law in support of defendant motion to dismiss in versata development group,rea,civ.action ed,may.a party may be dissatisfied with a final written decision in an inter partes review because the patent office lacked authority to institute the proceeding in the first place,or because the office committed some other error in the to its final decision.neither d nor prevents a party from pressing such issues on an appeal from the final decision.this is familiar practice under,which similarly limits appeals to final decisions of the district courts but allows appellants to challenge earlier rulings as part of those appeals.see quackenbush allstate ins,the general rule is that a party is entitled to a single appeal,to be deferred until final judgment has been entered,in which claims of district court error at any stage in the litigation may be ventilated internal quotation marks omitted wright,miller,cooper,federal practice and procedure,ed.noting the general rule that an appeal from final judgment permits review of all rulings that led up to the judgment and observing that t he variety of orders open to review on subsequent appeal from a final judgment is enormous and,as noted above,judicial review of final agency action likewise encompasses earlier rulings that are not directly reviewable.see supra,at.
does this provision authorize the patent office to issue a regulation stating that the agency,in inter partes review,
shall construe a patent claim according to its broadest reasonable construction in light of the specification of the patent in which it appears cfr b.
we conclude that the first provision,though it may not bar consideration of a constitutional question,for example,does bar judicial review of the kind of claim at issue here,involving the patent office decision to institute inter partes review.we also conclude that the second provision authorizes the patent office to issue the regulation before us.see,united states mead,chevron natural resources defense council.
a the text of d expressly states that the patent office determinations whether to institute inter partes review shall be final and nonappealable.moreover,construing d to permit judicial review of the patent office preliminary decision to institute inter partes review undercuts the important congressional objective of giving the agency significant power to revisit and revise earlier patent grants.past practice in respect to related proceedings,including the predecessor to inter partes review,also supports the conclusion that congress did not intend for courts to review these initial determinations.finally,reading d as limited to interlocutory appeals would render the provision largely superfluous in light of the administrative procedure act.
the statute provides that t he determination by the director whether to institute an inter partes review under this section shall be final and nonappealable.d.if inter partes review is instituted,the patent office conducts a trial that culminates in a final written decision on the patentability of the challenged claims.a.any patent owner or challenger that is dissatisfied with that decision may appeal to the federal circuit.
moving further away from the statutory text,the court next objects that allowing judicial review would undercut one important congressional objective,namely,giving the patent office significant power to revisit and revise earlier patent grants.ante,at.i am not sure that the court appreciates how remarkable this assertion is.it would give us cause to do away with judicial review whenever we think that review makes it harder for an agency to carry out important work.in any event,the majority logic is flawed.judicial review enforces the limits that congress has imposed on the agency power.it thus serves to buttress,not undercut,congress objectives.by asserting otherwise,the majority loses sight of the principle that no legislation pursues its purposes at all costs.rodriguez united states,per curiam.every statute purposes,not only to achieve certain ends,but also to achieve them by particular means and there is often a considerable legislative battle over what those means ought to be.the withholding of agency authority is as significant as the granting of it,and we have no right to play favorites between the two.director,office of workers compensation programs newport news shipbuilding dry dock.the inter partes review statute is no exception.it empowers the patent office to clean up bad patents,but it expressly forbids the patent office to institute inter partes review or even consider petitions for inter partes review unless certain conditions are satisfied.nothing in the statute suggests that congress wanted to improve patent quality at the cost of fidelity to the law.
we interpret congress grant of rulemaking authority in light of our decision in chevron.where a statute is clear,the agency must follow the statute,at.but where a statute leaves a gap or is ambigu ous,we typically interpret it as granting the agency leeway to enact rules that are reasonable in light of the text,nature,and purpose of the statute.mead,at chevron,supra,at.the statute contains such a gap no statutory provision unambiguously directs the agency to use one standard or the other.and the statute express ly authoriz es the patent office to engage in the process of rulemaking to address that gap.mead,supra,at.indeed,the statute allows the patent office to issue rules governing inter partes review,a,and the broadest reasonable construction regulation is a rule that governs inter partes review.
