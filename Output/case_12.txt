i maclean disclosure was not prohibited by the tsa regulations for purposes of section b a because regulations do not qualify as law under that statute.throughout section,congress repeatedly used the phrase law,rule,or regulation.but congress did not use that phrase in the statutory language at issue here it used the word law standing alone.congress choice to say specifically prohibited by law,instead of specifically prohibited by law,rule,or regulation suggests that congress meant to exclude rules and regulations.in addition,section b a creates a second exception for disclosures required by executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.that the second exception is limited to actions by the president himself suggests that the first exception does not include action taken by executive agencies.finally,interpreting the word law to include rules and regulations could defeat the purpose of the whistleblower statute.that interpretation would allow an agency to insulate itself from section b a simply by promulgating a regulation that specifically prohibited all whistleblowing.
in sum,when congress used the phrase specifically prohibited by law instead of specifically prohibited by law,rule,or regulation,it meant to exclude rules and regulations.we therefore hold that the tsa regulations do not qualify as law for purposes of section b a.
we next consider whether maclean disclosure regarding the canceled missions was specifically prohibited by r itself.as relevant here,that statute provides that the tsa shall prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclosure of information obtained or developed in carrying out security if the under secretary decides that disclosing the information would be detrimental to the security of transportation.r c.
this statute does not prohibit anything.on the,it authorizes something it authorizes the under secretary to prescribe regulations.thus,by its terms section r did not prohibit the disclosure at issue here.
ii likewise,maclean disclosure was not prohibited by section r.that statute does not prohibit anything instead,it authorizes the tsa to prescribe regulations.thus,by its terms,section r did not prohibit the disclosure here.the government responds that section r did prohibit maclean disclosure by imposing a legislative mandate on the tsa to promulgate regulations to that effect.but the statute affords substantial discretion to the tsa in deciding whether to prohibit any particular disclosure.thus,it is the tsa regulations not the statute that prohibited maclean disclosure,and those regulations do not qualify as law under section b a.
b the government argues that providing whistleblower protection to individuals like maclean would gravely endanger public safety by making the confidentiality of sensitive security information depend on the idiosyncratic judgment of each of the tsa employees.those concerns are legitimate,but they must be addressed by congress or the president,rather than by this court.
the government argues that this whistleblower statute does not protect maclean because his disclosure regarding the canceled missions was specifically prohibited by law in two ways.first,the government argues that the disclosure was specifically prohibited by the tsa regulations on sensitive security information cfr a b,j.second,the government argues that the disclosure was specifically prohibited by r,which authorized the tsa to those regulations.we address each argument in turn.
the government proposes two alternative interpretations,but neither is persuasive.first,the government argues that the word law includes all regulations that have the force and effect of law.the government bases this argument on the decision in chrysler brown,where this court held that legislative regulations generally fall within the meaning of the word law unless there is a clear showing of contrary legislative intent.at.but congress use of the word law,in close connection with the phrase law,rule,or regulation,provides the necessary clear showing that law does not include regulations in this case.second,the government argues that the word law includes at least those regulations that were promulgated pursuant to an express congressional directive.the government,however,was unable to find a single example of the word law being used in that way.
the government description of chrysler is accurate enough.but congress use of the word law,in close connection with the phrase law,rule,or regulation,provides the necessary clear showing that law does not include regulations.indeed,using law and law,rule,or regulation in the same sentence would be a very obscure way of drawing the government nuanced distinction between different types of regulations.had congress wanted to draw that distinction,there were far easier and clearer ways to do so.for example,at the time congress passed section b a,another federal statute defined the words regulatory order to include a rule or regulation,if it has the force and effect of law.a ed.likewise,another federal statute defined the words state law to include all laws,decisions,rules,regulations,or other state action having the effect of law.c ed.as those examples show,congress knew how to distinguish between regulations that had the force and effect of law and those that did not,but chose not to do so in section b a.
second,the government argues that the word law includes at least those regulations that were promulgated pursuant to an express congressional directive.brief for petitioner.outside of this case,however,the government was unable to find a single example of the word law being used in that way.not a single dictionary definition,not a single statute,not a single case.the government interpretation happens to fit this case precisely,but it needs more than that to recommend it.
in,congress enacted the homeland security act,stat.as relevant here,that act provides that the tsa shall prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclosure of information obtained or developed in carrying out security if the under secretary decides that disclosing the information would be detrimental to the security of transportation.r c.
around the same time,the tsa promulgated regulations prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure of what it called sensitive security information.see fed.reg.the regulations described categories of sensitive security information,including s pecific details of aviation security measures such as information concerning specific numbers of federal air marshals,deployments or missions,and the methods involved in such operations.cfr j.sensitive security information is not classified,so the tsa can share it with individuals who do not have a security clearance,such as airport employees.compare exec.order,cfr,comp,with cfr c.
robert maclean became a federal air marshal for the tsa in.in that role,maclean was assigned to protect passenger flights from potential hijackings.see a.
on july,the department of homeland security dhs issued a confidential advisory about a potential hijacking plot.the advisory said that members of the terrorist group al qaeda were planning to attack passenger flights,and that they considered suicide hijackings and bombings as the most promising methods to destroy aircraft in flight,as well as to strike ground targets.app.the advisory identified a number of potential targets,including the united kingdom,italy,australia,and the east coast of the united states.finally,the advisory warned that at least one of the attacks could be executed by the end of the summer.ibid.
the dissent tries to downplay the scope of that discretion,viewing it as the almost ministerial task of identifying whether a particular piece of information falls within the scope of congress command.post,at.but determining which documents meet the statutory standard of detrimental to the security of transportation requires the exercise of considerable judgment.for example,the government says that section r requires the under secretary to prohibit disclosures like maclean.the government also says,however,that the statute does not require the under secretary to prohibit an employee from disclosing that federal air marshals will be absent from important flights,but declining to specify which flights.reply brief.that distinction comes not from section r itself,but from the under secretary exercise of discretion.it is the tsa regulations not the statute that prohibited maclean disclosure.and as the dissent agrees,a regulation does not count as law under the whistleblower statute.see post,at.
in,congress enacted the homeland security act,stat.that act provides that the transportation security administration tsa shall prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclosure of information if the under secretary decides that disclosur e would be detrimental to the security of transportation.r c.around the same time,the tsa promulgated regulations prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive security information,fed.reg,which included s pecific details of aviation security measures such as information concerning specific numbers of federal air marshals,deployments or missions,and the methods involved in such operations,cfr j.
in july,the tsa briefed all federal air marshals including robert maclean about a potential plot to hijack passenger flights.a few days after the briefing,maclean received from the tsa a text message cancelling all overnight missions from las vegas until early august.maclean,who was stationed in las vegas,believed that cancelling those missions during a hijacking alert was dangerous and illegal.he therefore contacted a reporter and told him about the tsa decision to cancel the missions.after discovering that maclean was the source of the disclosure,the tsa fired him for disclosing sensitive security information without authorization.
in,the tsa regulations prohibited the disclosure of s pecific details of aviation security measures such as information concerning specific numbers of federal air marshals,deployments or missions,and the methods involved in such operations.cfr j.maclean does not dispute before this court that the tsa regulations prohibited his disclosure regarding the canceled missions.thus,the question here is whether a disclosure that is specifically prohibited by regulation is also specifically prohibited by law under section b a.emphasis added.
the court of appeals for the federal circuit vacated the board decision.the parties had agreed that,in order for maclean disclosure to be specifically prohibited by law,it must have been prohibited by a statute rather than by a regulation.at emphasis added.thus,the issue before the court was whether the statute authorizing the tsa regulations now codified at r specifically prohibited maclean disclosure,at.
the court first held that section r was not a prohibition.the statute did not expressly prohibit employee disclosures,the court explained,but instead empowered the tsa to prescribe regulations prohibiting disclosure s if the tsa decided that disclosing the information would harm public safety,at.the court therefore concluded that maclean disclosure was prohibited by a regulation,which the parties had agreed could not be a law under section b a.ibid.
first,the government argues that the word law includes all regulations that have the force and effect of law legislative regulations,while excluding those that do not,interpretive rules.brief for petitioner.the government bases this argument on our decision in chrysler brown.there,we held that legislative regulations generally fall within the meaning of the word law,and that it would take a clear showing of contrary legislative intent before we concluded otherwise,at.thus,because the tsa regulations have the force and effect of law,the government says that they should qualify as law under the statute.
the government responds that section r did prohibit maclean disclosure by imposing a legislative mandate on the tsa to promulgate regulations to that effect.see brief for petitioner,see also post,at sotomayor,dissenting.but the government pushes the statute too far.section r says that the tsa shall prohibit disclosures only if the under secretary decides that disclosing the information would be detrimental to the security of transportation.r c emphasis added.that language affords substantial discretion to the tsa in deciding whether to prohibit any particular disclosure.
a the government argues that maclean disclosure was specifically prohibited by law in two ways first,by the tsa regulations on sensitive security information,and second,by section r itself,which authorized the tsa to promulgate those regulations.
