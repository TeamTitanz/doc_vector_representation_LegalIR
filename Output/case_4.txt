d the hornes are not required to first pay the fine and then seek compensation under the tucker act.see horne,at.because they have the full economic interest in the raisins the government alleges should have been set aside for its account,they own the raisins they grew as well as the raisins they handled,having paid the growers for all of their raisins,not just their raisins they may raise a defense to the fine levied against them.there is no need for the ninth circuit to calculate the just compensation due on remand.the clear and administrable rule is that just compensation normally is to be measured by the market value of the property at the time of the taking.united states acres of land.here,the government already calculated that amount when it fined the hornes the fair market value of the raisins.
if we apply bauman and its progeny to the marketing order reserve requirement,the benefit to the raisins may be set off against the value of the reserve raisins taken.miller,supra,at.the value of the raisins taken might exceed the value of the benefit conferred.in that case,the reserve requirement effects a taking without just compensation,and the hornes decision not to comply with the requirement was justified.on the other hand,the benefit might equal or exceed the value of the raisins taken.in that case,the california raisin marketing order does not effect a taking without just compensation.see mccoy,supra,at in such a case the owner really loses nothing which he had before and it may be said with reason,there has been no real injury brown legal foundation of,i f petitioners net loss was zero,the compensation that is due is also zero and even the hornes agree that if the reserve requirement does not effect a taking without just compensation,then they can not use the takings clause to excuse their failure to comply with the marketing order or to justify their refusal to pay the fine and penalty imposed based on that failure.see brief for petitioners the constitutionality of the fine rises or falls on the constitutionality of the marketing order reserve requirement and attendant transfer of reserve raisins internal quotation marks omitted.
on remand,the ninth circuit agreed with the hornes that the validity of the fine rose or fell with the constitutionality of the reserve requirement.the court then considered whether that requirement was a physical appropriation of property,giving rise to a per se taking,or a restriction on a raisin grower use of his property,properly analyzed under the more flexible and forgiving standard for a regulatory taking.the court rejected the hornes argument that the reserve requirement was a per se taking,reasoning that the takings clause affords less protection to personal than to real property,and concluding that the hornes are not completely divested of their property rights,because growers retain an interest in the proceeds from any sale of reserve raisins by the raisin committee,at.
the hornes sought relief in federal court,arguing that the reserve requirement was an unconstitutional taking of their property under the fifth amendment.on remand from this court over the issue of jurisdiction,horne department of agriculture,the ninth circuit held that the reserve requirement was not a fifth amendment taking.the court determined that the requirement was not a per se taking because personal property is afforded less protection under the takings clause than real property and because the hornes,who retained an interest in any net proceeds,were not completely divested of their property.the ninth circuit held that,as in cases allowing the government to set conditions on land use and development,the government imposed a condition the reserve requirement in exchange for a government benefit an orderly raisin market.it held that the hornes could avoid relinquishing large percentages of their crop by planting different crops.
the hornes and the court both concede that a cap on the quantity of raisins that the hornes can sell would not be a per se taking.see ante,at brief for petitioners.the court focus on the physical nature of the intrusion also suggests that merely arranging for the sale of the reserve raisins would not be a per se taking.the rub for the court must therefore be not that the government is doing these things,but that it is accomplishing them by the altogether understandable requirement that the reserve raisins be physically set aside.i know of no principle,however,providing that if the government achieves a permissible regulatory end by asking regulated individuals or entities to physically move the property subject to the regulation,it has committed a per se taking rather than a potential regulatory taking.after all,in monsanto,the data that the pesticide companies had to turn over to the government was presumably turned over in some physical form,yet even the court does not call monsanto a physical takings case.it therefore can not be that any regulation that involves the slightest physical movement of property is necessarily evaluated as a per se taking rather than as a regulatory taking.
ultimately,the majority rejects the government request for a remand because it believes that the government does not suggest that the marketing order affords the hornes compensation in the amount of the fine that the government assessed.ante,at.in my view,however,the relevant precedent indicates that the takings clause requires compensation in an amount equal to the value of the reserve raisins adjusted to account for the benefits received.and the government does,indeed,suggest that the marketing order affords just compensation.see brief for respondent it is likely that when all benefits and alleged losses from the marketing order are calculated,the hornes would have a net gain rather than a net loss,given that a central point of the order is to benefit producers further,the hornes have not demonstrated the contrary.before granting judgment in favor of the hornes,a court should address the issue in light of all of the relevant facts and law.
raisin growers subject to the reserve requirement thus lose the entire bundle of property rights in the appropriated raisins the rights to possess,use and dispose of them,loretto,at internal quotation marks omitted with the exception of the speculative hope that some residual proceeds may be left when the government is done with the raisins and has deducted the expenses of implementing all aspects of the marketing order.the government actual taking of possession and control of the reserve raisins gives rise to a taking as clearly as if the government held full title and ownership,at internal quotation marks omitted,as it essentially does.the government formal demand that the hornes turn over a percentage of their raisin crop without charge,for the government control and use,is of such a unique character that it is a taking without regard to other factors that a court might ordinarily examine.at.
the agricultural marketing agreement act of authorizes the secretary of agriculture to promulgate marketing orders to help maintain stable markets for particular agricultural products.the marketing order for raisins established a raisin administrative committee that imposes a reserve requirement a requirement that growers set aside a certain percentage of their crop for the account of the government,free of charge.the government makes use of those raisins by selling them in noncompetitive markets,donating them,or disposing of them by any means consistent with the purposes of the program.if any profits are left over after subtracting the government expenses from administering the program,the net proceeds are distributed back to the raisin growers.in,raisin growers were required to set aside percent of their raisin crop under the reserve requirement.in,percent.marvin horne,laura horne,and their family are raisin growers who refused to set aside any raisins for the government on the ground that the reserve requirement was an unconstitutional taking of their property for public use without just compensation.the government fined the hornes the fair market value of the raisins as well as additional civil penalties for their failure to obey the raisin marketing order.
the court contrary conclusion rests upon two fundamental errors.the first is the court breezy assertion that a per se taking has occurred because the hornes lose the entire bundle of property rights in the appropriated raisins with the exception of the retained interest in the equitable distribution of the proceeds from the disposition of the reserve raisins.ante,at.but if there is a property right that has not been lost,as the court concedes there is,then the order has not destroyed each of the hornes rights in the reserve raisins and does not effect a per se taking.the court protests that the retained interest is not substantial or certain enough.but while i see more value in that interest than the court does,the bottom line is that loretto does not distinguish among retained property interests that are substantial or certain enough to count and others that are not nor is it at all clear how the court approach will be administrable.how,after all,are courts,governments,or individuals supposed to know how much a property owner must be left with before this court will bless the retained interest as sufficiently meaningful and certain.
b the fact that the growers are entitled to the net proceeds of the raisin sales does not mean that there has been no taking at all.when there has been a physical appropriation,we do not ask whether it deprives the owner of all economically valuable use of the item taken.preservation council,at.the fact that the growers retain a contingent interest of indeterminate value does not mean there has been no taking,particularly when that interest depends on the discretion of the taker,and may be worthless,as it was for one of the two years at issue here.andrus allard,distinguished.once there is a taking,as in the case of a physical appropriation,any payment from the government in connection with that action goes,at most,to the question of just compensation.
on the record before us,the hornes have not established that the government,through the raisin reserve program,takes raisins without just compensation.when the government takes as reserve raisins a percentage of the annual crop,the raisin owners retain the remaining,raisins.the reserve requirement is intended,at least in part,to enhance the price that raisins will fetch on the open market.see cfr.and any such enhancement matters.this court precedents indicate that,when calculating the just compensation that the fifth amendment requires,a court should deduct from the value of the taken reserve raisins any enhancement caused by the taking to the value of the remaining raisins.
when the government sought to collect the fine,the hornes turned to the courts,arguing that the reserve requirement was an unconstitutional taking of their property under the fifth amendment.their case eventually made it to this court when the government argued that the lower courts had no jurisdiction to consider the hornes constitutional defense to the fine.horne department of agriculture,horne i.we rejected the government argument and sent the case back to the court of appeals so it could address the hornes contention on the merits,at slip,at.
but when there has been a physical appropriation,we do not ask whether it deprives the owner of all economically valuable use of the item taken.preservation council,at see,at when the government physically takes possession of an interest in property for some public purpose,it has a categorical duty to compensate the former owner,regardless of whether the interest that is taken constitutes an entire parcel or merely a part thereof.citation omitted.for example,in loretto,we held that the installation of a cable box on a small corner of loretto rooftop was a per se taking,even though she could of course still sell and economically benefit from the property,at.the fact that the growers retain a contingent interest of indeterminate value does not mean there has been no physical taking,particularly since the value of the interest depends on the discretion of the taker,and may be worthless,as it was for one of the two years at issue here.
i join the court opinion in full.i write separately to offer an additional observation concerning justice breyer argument that we should remand the case.the takings clause prohibits the government from taking private property except for public use,even when it offers just compensation.amdt.that requirement,as originally understood,imposes a meaningful constraint on the power of the state the government may take property only if it actually uses or gives the public a legal right to use the property.kelo new london,thomas,dissenting.it is far from clear that the raisin administrative committee conduct meets that standard.it takes the raisins of citizens and,among other things,gives them away or sells them to exporters,foreign importers,and foreign governments.cfr b.to the extent that the committee is not taking the raisins for public use,having the court of appeals calculate just compensation in this case would be a fruitless exercise.
understood together,these cases demonstrate that the government may condition the ability to offer goods in the market on the of certain property interests without effecting a per se taking the order is a similar regulation.it has no effect whatsoever on raisins that the hornes grow for their own use.but insofar as the hornes wish to sell some raisins in a market regulated by the government and at a price supported by governmental intervention,the order requires that they give up the right to sell a portion of those raisins at that price and instead accept disposal of them at a lower price.given that we have held that the government may impose a price on the privilege of engaging in a particular business without effecting a taking which is all that the order does it follows that the order at the very least does not run afoul of our per se takings jurisprudence.under a different takings test,one might reach a different conclusion.but the hornes have advanced only this narrow per se takings claim,and that claim fails.
