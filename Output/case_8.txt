section of the fvra authorizes four categories of officials to perform the duties of a vacant office.subsection a contains a default rule the first assistant to the office automatically assumes the vacant office and performs the functions and duties of the office temporarily in an acting capacity.a.subsections a,a,and c authorize the president to override that default rule.the president may direct a person already confirmed by the senate to a pas office to serve as the acting officer.see a.the president may direct certain senior officials in the same agency to serve as the acting officer.see a.or the president may direct a person whose term in the office has expired and who has been nominated to a subsequent term in that same office to serve as the acting officer until the senate acts on the nomination.see c.
subsection b takes away this authorization in a specific situation.it provides that,n otwithstanding subsection a the first assistant default rule a person may not serve as an acting official while nominated to fill the office if the person was not the first assistant to the office for at least of the days preceding the vacancy.b.the prohibition in subsection b does not apply to a person serving as the first assistant to the vacant office.see b.
in my view,the text,purpose,and history of the fvra make clear that the prohibition in subsection b applies only to a first assistant who performs the duties of a vacant office under subsection a.
as the court observes,subsection b contains some potentially broad language.the provision specifies when a person may not serve as an acting officer for an office under this section that is.the words person and this section,taken in isolation,could signal that the prohibition applies to subsections a,a,a,and c and thus covers all acting officials.but context matters.and here,the context cabins those words and gives subsection b a more limited reach.
notwithstanding paragraph,the president and only the president may direct a person who serves in an office for which appointment is required to be made by the president,by and with the advice and consent of the senate,to perform the functions and duties of the vacant office temporarily in an acting capacity subject to the time limitations of section or.
a such person is serving as the first assistant to the office of an officer described under subsection a. b the office of such first assistant is an office for which appointment is required to be made by the president,by and with the advice and consent of the senate and.
subsection b applies to any person and prohibits service as an acting officer for an office under this section.person has an expansive meaning that can encompass anyone who performs acting duties under the fvra.see pfizer government of india.and under this section clarifies that subsection b applies to all of the fvra contains to specific subsections and paragraphs.but subsection b refers to,which contains all of the ways a person may become an acting officer.the rest of the fvra also uses the pairing of person and section to encompass anyone serving as an acting officer under the fvra,and congress could readily have used more specific language if it intended subsection b to apply only to first assistants acting under a.
the dependent clause at the beginning of subsection b n otwithstanding subsection a confirms the breadth of the prohibition on acting service by nominees.in statutes,notwithstanding clauses show that one provision prevails over another in the event of a conflict.here,that means that subsection b applies even when it conflicts with the default rule in a that first assistants shall perform acting duties.
the fvra governs the process by which the president may temporarily fill a vacancy in an executive branch office normally occupied by an officer of the united states.as relevant in this case,when a vacancy arises,the president may direct an official to perform the functions and duties of the office temporarily.a.that official may be an officer previously appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate to any office,or certain employees of the agency in which the vacancy arose.ibid.the fvra does not,however,require the president to seek the advice and consent of the senate before directing the official to perform the functions of the vacant office.
section also makes certain individuals ineligible for acting service.subsection b states notwithstanding subsection a,a person may not serve as an acting officer for an office under this section if the president nominates him for the vacant pas office and,during the period preceding the vacancy,the individual did not serve in the position of first assistant to that office or served in that position for less than days.subsection b creates an exception to this prohibition,providing that p aragraph shall not apply to any person serving in a first assistant position that itself requires the senate advice and consent.
the dependent clause at the beginning of subsection b n otwithstanding subsection a confirms that the prohibition on acting service applies even when it conflicts with the default rule that the first assistant shall perform acting duties.the ordinary meaning of notwithstanding is in spite of,or without prevention or obstruction from or by.webster third new international dictionary black law dictionary ed.despite in spite of in statutes,the word shows which provision prevails in the event of a clash.scalia garner,reading law the interpretation of legal texts.subsection a sets the rule that first assistants shall perform the vacant office functions and duties in an acting capacity.but the notwithstanding clause in subsection b means that,even if a first assistant is serving as an acting officer under this statutory mandate,he must cease that service if the president nominates him to fill the vacant pas office.that subsection b also applies to acting officers serving at the president behest is already clear from the broad text of the independent clause they are all person s serving under this section.
many offices in the executive branch may be filled only by a person who has been nominated to the position by the president and confirmed by the senate.the federal vacancies reform act of fvra cedes the senate confirmation authority,partially and on a temporary basis,to allow executive agencies to continue to function when one of those offices becomes vacant.it authorizes certain categories of officials to perform the duties of vacant offices on an acting basis.one of its provisions pulls back that authorization when an official has been nominated to fill the vacant office on a permanent basis.the scope of that provision is at issue here.i agree with the court that the provision applies to first assistants to a vacant office who serve as acting officials automatically,by operation of the fvra.i with the court conclusion that the provision also applies to other officials who may serve as acting officials if the president directs them to serve in that capacity.the court gives the provision a broader reach than the text can bear with no support from the history of,or practice under,the fvra.i respectfully dissent.
section also makes certain individuals ineligible for acting service.subsection b states notwithstanding subsection a,a person may not serve as an acting officer for an office under this section if the president nominates him for the vacant pas office and,during the period preceding the vacancy,the person did not serve in the position of first assistant to that office or served in that position for less than days.
the first assistant to the office of such officer shall perform the functions and duties of the office temporarily in an acting capacity subject to the time limitations of section.
the current version of that authorization is the federal vacancies reform act of fvra.section a of the fvra permits three categories of government officials to perform acting service in a vacant pas office.subsection a prescribes the general rule that,if a vacancy arises in a pas office,the first assistant to that office shall perform the office functions and duties temporarily in an acting capacity.subsections a and a provide that,notwithstanding paragraph,the president may direct a person already serving in another pas office,or a senior employee in the relevant agency,to serve in an acting capacity instead.
in january,an nlrb regional director,exercising authority on solomon behalf,issued an unfair labor practices complaint against respondent sw general.an administrative law judge concluded that sw general had committed unfair labor practices,and the nlrb agreed.sw general sought review in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit,arguing that the complaint was invalid because,under subsection b of the fvra,solomon could not perform the duties of general counsel to the nlrb after having been nominated to fill that position.the nlrb countered that subsection b applies only to first assistants who automatically assume acting duties under subsection a,not to acting officers who,like solomon,serve under a or a.the court of appeals vacated the board order.it concluded that the prohibition on acting service by nominees contained in subsection b applies to all acting officers,regardless of whether they serve pursuant to subsection a,a,or a.as a result,solomon became ineligible to perform the duties of general counsel in an acting capacity once the president nominated him to fill that post.
the board argues that subsection b was designed to serve a specific purpose preventing the president from having his nominee serve as an acting officer by making him first assistant after or right before a vacancy arises.brief for petitioner.the original draft of the fvra authorized first assistants and pas officers to perform acting service.subsection b of that draft provided that if a first assistant was nominated to fill the vacant office,he could not perform that office duties in an acting capacity unless he had been the first assistant for at least days before the vacancy.several senators thought the fvra too restrictive.they asked to add senior agency officials to the list of potential acting officers and to shorten the requirement in subsection b.their requests,the board says,were granted the final version of the fvra included subsection a for senior employees and shortened the requirement to days.there was no intent to extend the prohibition in subsection b beyond first assistants,at.
applying the fvra to this case is straightforward.solomon was appointed as acting general counsel under subsection a.once the president submitted his nomination to fill that position in a permanent capacity,subsection b prohibited him from continuing his acting service.this does not mean that the duties of general counsel to the nlrb needed to go unperformed the president could have appointed another person to serve as the acting officer in solomon place.and he had a wide array of individuals to choose from any one of the approximately senior nlrb employees or the hundreds of individuals in pas positions throughout the government.the president,however,did not do so,and solomon continued service violated the fvra.accordingly,the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.
the general counsel of the nlrb appears to satisfy that definition.before,the board controlled not only the filing of complaints,but their prosecution and adjudication as well.nlrb food commercial workers.the labor management relations act,ch,stat,however,effected an important change in the nlrb structure by separat ing the prosecuting from the adjudicating function,to place the former in the general counsel,and to make him an independent official appointed by the president.lewis nlrb.congress thus separated the nlrb into two independent branches,food commercial workers,at,and made the general counsel independent of the board supervision and review,at see also,at congress decided to place the general counsel within the agency,but to make the office independent of the board authority moreover,the general counsel prosecutorial decisions are unreviewable by either the board or the judiciary.nlrb sears,roebuck,vaca sipes.although the board has power to define some of the general counsel duties,see d,and the general counsel represents the board in certain judicial proceedings,see higgins,labor czars commissars keeping women in the kitchen the purpose and effects of the administrative changes made by,cath,the statute does not give the board the power to remove him or otherwise generally to control his activities,see edmond,supra,at the power to remove officers,we have recognized,is a powerful tool for control see also free enterprise fund,at holding that executive officials were inferior officers in large part because they were subject to a superior removal.because it appears that the general counsel answers to no officer inferior to the president,he is likely a principal officer accordingly,the president likely could not lawfully have appointed solomon to serve in that role without first obtaining the advice and consent of the senate.
