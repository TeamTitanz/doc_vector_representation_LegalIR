ferc statutory authority extends to the rule at issue here addressing wholesale demand response.the rule governs a practice directly affecting wholesale electricity rates.and although inevitably influencing the retail market too,the rule does not intrude on the states power to regulate retail sales.ferc set the terms of transactions occurring in the organized wholesale markets,so as to ensure the reasonableness of wholesale prices and the reliability of the interstate grid just as the fpa contemplates.and in choosing a compensation formula,the commission met its duty of reasoned judgment.ferc took full account of the alternative policies proposed,and adequately supported and explained its decision.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and remand the cases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the act grants ferc authority to regulate the generation and transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of such energy at wholesale.a.yet the majority frames the issue thusly t o uphold the r ule,we also must determine that it does not regulate retail electricity sales.ante,at.that formulation inverts the proper inquiry.the pertinent question under the act is whether the rule regulates sales at wholesale.if so,it falls within ferc regulatory authority.if not,the rule is unauthorized whether or not it happens to regulate retail electricity sales for,with exceptions not material here,the fpa prohibits ferc from regulating any other sale of electric energy that is not at wholesale.b emphasis added.the majority wisely ignores ferc specious argument that the rule does not regulate any sale,wholesale or retail.see brief for petitioner in.paying someone not to conclude a transaction that otherwise would without a doubt have been concluded is most assuredly a regulation of that transaction.gonzales raich,scalia,concurring in judgment.
a divided panel of the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacated the rule as ultra vires agency action.the court held that ferc lacked authority to issue the rule even though demand response compensation affects the wholesale market.at.the commission jurisdiction to regulate practices affecting rates,the court stated,does not erase the specific limit that the fpa imposes on ferc regulation of retail sales,at.and the rule,the court concluded,exceeds that limit in luring retail customers into the wholesale market,and causing them to decrease levels of retail electricity consumption,the rule engages in direct regulation of the retail market.at.
the rule rejected an alternative scheme for compensating demand response bids.several commenters had urged that,in paying a demand response provider,an operator should subtract from the ordinary wholesale price the savings that the provider nets by not buying electricity on the retail market.otherwise,the commenters claimed,demand response providers would receive a kind of relative to generators.see,at.that proposal,which the dissenting commissioner largely accepted,became known as lmp minus g,or more simply,where g stands for the retail price of electricity.see,at,moeller,dissenting.but ferc explained that,under the conditions it had specified,the value of an accepted demand response bid to the wholesale market is identical to that of an accepted supply bid because each succeeds in balanc ing supply and demand.at.and,the commission reasoned,that comparable value is what ought to matter given ferc goal of strengthening competition in the wholesale market rates should reflect not the costs that each market participant incurs,but instead the services it provides.see,at.moreover,the rule stated,compensating demand response bids at their actual value,lmp will help overcome various technological barriers,including a lack of needed infrastructure,that impede aggregators and users of electricity from fully participating in demand response programs.see,at.
indeed,the finishing blow to both of epsa arguments comes from ferc notable solicitude toward the states.as explained earlier,the rule allows any state regulator to prohibit its consumers from making demand response bids in the wholesale market.see,at,at,supra,at.although claiming the ability to negate such state decisions,the commission chose not to do so in recognition of the linkage between wholesale and retail markets and the states role in overseeing retail sales.see fed.reg.the veto power thus granted to the states belies epsa view that ferc aimed to obliterate their regulatory authority or override their pricing policies.brief for respondents.and that veto gives states the means to block whatever effective increases in retail rates demand response programs might be thought to produce.wholesale demand response as implemented in the rule is a program of cooperative federalism,in which the states retain the last word.that feature of the rule removes any conceivable doubt as to its compliance with b allocation of federal and state authority.
and when,years later after congress,too,endorsed the practice,ferc began to play a more proactive role,it did so for the identical reason to enhance the wholesale,not retail,electricity market.like the market operators,ferc saw that demand in peak periods threatened network breakdowns,compelled purchases from inefficient generators,and consequently drove up wholesale prices.see,fed.reg,at,see supra,at.addressing those problems which demand response does falls within the sweet spot of ferc statutory charge.so ferc took action promoting the practice.no doubt ferc recognized connections,running in both directions,between the states policies and its own.the commission understood that by insulating consumers from price fluctuations,states contributed to the wholesale market difficulties in optimally balancing supply and demand.see fed.reg,supra,at.and ferc realized that increased use of demand response in that market would by definition inhibit retail sales otherwise subject to state control.see fed.reg.but nothing supports epsa more feverish idea that the commission interest in wholesale demand response emerged from a yen to usurp state authority over,or impose its own regulatory agenda on,retail sales.in promoting demand response,ferc did no more than follow the dictates of its regulatory mission to improve the competitiveness,efficiency,and reliability of the wholesale market.
so what,exactly,is a sale of electric energy at wholesale we need not guess,for the act provides a definition a sale of electric energy to any person for resale.d emphasis added.no matter how many times the majority incants and italicizes the word wholesale,ante,at,nothing can change the fact that the vast majority of and likely all participants a ggregators of multiple users of electricity,as well as individual users like factories or stores,ante,at do not resell electric energy they consume it themselves.ferc own definition of demand response is aimed at energy consumers,not resellers.cfr b.
it is therefore quite beside the point that the challenged r ule addresses and addresses only transactions occurring on the wholesale market,ante,at.for ferc regulatory authority over sales depends not on which market the transactions occu r on whatever that means,but rather on the identity of the putative purchaser.if the purchaser is one who resells electric energy to other customers,the transaction is one at wholesale and thus within ferc authority.if not,then not.or so,at least,says the statute.as we long ago said of the parallel provision in the natural gas act,t he line of the statute i s thus clear and complete.it cut s sharply and cleanly between sales for resale and direct sales for consumptive uses.no exceptions a re made in either category for particular uses,quantities,or otherwise.panhandle eastern pipe line public serv.comm of.the majority makes no textual response to this plain reading of the statute.
and in setting rules for demand response,that is all ferc has done.the commission rule addresses and addresses only transactions occurring on the wholesale market.recall once again how demand response works and forgive the coming italics.see supra,at.wholesale market operators administer the entire program,receiving every demand response bid made.those operators accept such a bid at the mandated price when and only when the bid provides value to the wholesale market by balancing supply and demand more ly at a lower cost to wholesale purchasers than a bid to generate power.fed.reg.the compensation paid for a successful bid lmp is whatever the operator auction has determined is the marginal price of wholesale electricity at a particular location and time.see,at.and those footing the bill are the same wholesale purchasers that have benefited from the lower wholesale price demand response participation has produced.see,at.in sum,whatever the effects at the retail level,every aspect of the regulatory plan happens exclusively on the wholesale market and governs exclusively that market rules.
these demand response programs work through the operators regular auctions.aggregators of multiple users of electricity,as well as individual users like factories or stores,submit bids to decrease electricity consumption by a set amount at a set time for a set price.the wholesale market operators treat those offers just like bids from generators to increase supply.the operators,that is,rank order all the bids both to produce and to refrain from consuming electricity from least to most expensive,and then accept the lowest bids until supply and demand come into equipoise.and,once again,the lses pick up the cost of all those payments.so,to return to our prior example,if a store submitted an offer not to use a unit of electricity at on august for,the operator would accept that bid before calling on the generator that offered to produce a unit of power for.that would result in a lower lmp again,wholesale market price than if the market operator could not avail itself of demand response pledges.see council,harnessing the power of demand how isos and rtos are integrating demand response into wholesale electricity markets estimating that,in one market,a demand response program reducing electricity usage by in peak hours would lead to price declines of to.and it would decrease the risk of blackouts and other service problems.
what is more,the commission justifications for regulating demand response are all about,and only about,improving the wholesale market.oneok,at slip,at considering the target at which a law aims in determining whether a state is properly regulating retail or,instead,improperly regulating wholesale sales.in order,ferc explained that demand response participation could help create a competitive wholesale electric energy market with reduce d wholesale power prices and enhance d reliability.fed.reg.and in the rule under review,ferc expanded on that theme.it listed the several ways in which demand response in organized wholesale energy markets can help improve the functioning and competitiveness of those markets by replacing,inefficient generation exerting downward pressure on generator bidding strategies and support ing system reliability.at,see notice of proposed rulemaking for order,at,noting similar aims supra,at.ferc,that is,focused wholly on the benefits that demand response participation in the wholesale market could bring to the wholesale market.the retail market figures no more in the rule goals than in the mechanism through which the rule operates.
and that outcome would flout the fpa core objects.the statute aims to protect against excessive prices and ensure effective transmission of electric power.pennsylvania water power fpc,see gulf states util.fpc.as shown above,ferc has amply explained how wholesale demand response helps to achieve those ends,by bringing down costs and preventing service interruptions in peak periods.see supra,at.no one taking part in the rulemaking process not even epsa seriously challenged that account.even as he objected to ferc compensation formula,commissioner moeller noted the unanimity of opinion as to demand response value n owhere did i review any comment or hear any testimony that questioned the benefit of having demand response resources participate in the organized wholesale energy markets.on this point,there is no debate.fed.reg.see also app,epsa,comments on proposed rule avowing full support for demand response participation in wholesale markets because of its economic and operational benefits congress itself agreed,encourag ing greater use of demand response participation at the wholesale level.epact f,stat.that undisputed judgment extinguishes any last flicker of life in epsa argument.we will not read the fpa,against its clear terms,to halt a practice that so evidently enables the commission to fulfill its statutory duties of holding down prices and enhancing reliability in the wholesale energy market.
the above conclusion does not end our inquiry into the commission statutory authority to uphold the rule,we also must determine that it does not regulate retail electricity sales.that is because,as earlier described,b limit s ferc sale jurisdiction to that at wholesale,reserving regulatory authority over retail sales as well as intrastate wholesale sales to the states.new york,at emphasis deleted see b supra,at ferc can not take an action transgressing that limit no matter how direct,or dramatic,its impact on wholesale rates.suppose,to take a example,that the commission issued a regulation compelling every consumer to buy a certain amount of electricity on the retail market.such a rule would necessarily determine the load purchased on the wholesale market too,and thus would alter wholesale prices.but even given that ineluctable consequence,the regulation would exceed ferc authority,as defined in b,because it specifies terms of sale at retail which is a job for the states alone.
epsa primary argument that ferc has usurped state power echoed in the dissent maintains that the rule effectively,even though not nominal ly,regulates retail prices.see,brief for respondents,tr.of oral arg,post,at.the argument begins on universally accepted ground under b,only the states,not ferc,can set retail rates.see,fpc conway.but as epsa concedes,that tenet alone can not make its case,because ferc rule does not set actual rates states continue to make or approve all retail rates,and in doing so may insulate them from price fluctuations in the wholesale market.see brief for respondents.still,epsa contends,rudimentary economic analysis shows that the rule does the functional equivalen t of setting more particularly,of raising retail rates,at.that is because the opportunity to make demand response bids in the wholesale market changes consumers calculations.in deciding whether to buy electricity at retail,consumers now consider both the cost of making such a purchase and the cost of forgoing a possible demand response payment.so,epsa explains,if a factory can buy electricity for,but can earn for not buying power at peak times,then the effective retail rate at those times is the the factory paid at retail plus the it passed up.see,at.and by thus increasing effective retail rates,epsa concludes,ferc trespasses on the states ground.
that rationale received added support from ferc adoption of the net benefits test.the commission realized during its rulemaking that in some circumstances a demand response bid despite reducing the wholesale rate does not provide the same value as generation.see fed.reg.as described earlier,that happens when the distinctive costs associated with compensating a demand response bid exceed the savings from a lower wholesale rate the purchaser then winds up paying more than if the operator had accepted the best even though higher priced supply bid available.see supra,at.and so ferc developed the net benefits test to filter out such cases.see fed.reg.with that standard in place,lmp is paid only to demand response bids that benefit wholesale purchasers in other words,to those that function as alternative s to the next generation.at.thus,under the commission approach,a demand response provider will receive the same compensation as a generator only when it is in fact providing the same service to the wholesale market.see.
the commission responded at length to epsa contrary view that paying lmp,even in that situation,will overcompensate demand response providers because they are also effectively receiv ing g,the retail rate that they do not need to pay.at.ferc explained that compensation ordinarily reflects only the value of the service an entity provides not the costs it incurs,or benefits it obtains,in the process.so when a generator presents a bid,the commission does not inquire into the costs or benefits of production.different power plants have different cost structures.and,indeed,some plants receive tax credits and similar incentive payments for their activities,while others do not.see rehearing order,ferc,at,and.but the commission had long since decided that such matters are irrelevant paying lmp to all generators although some then walk away with more profit and some with less encourages more efficient supply and demand decisions.fed.reg,internal quotation marks omitted.and the commission could see no economic reason to treat demand response providers any differently.like generators,they too experience a range of benefits and costs both the benefits of not paying for electricity and the costs of not using it at a certain time.but,ferc again concluded,that is immaterial to increase competition and optimally balance supply and demand,market operators should compensate demand response providers,like generators,based on their contribution to the wholesale system.see ferc,at.
