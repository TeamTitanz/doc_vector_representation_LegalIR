these cases concern the efforts of congress and the environmental protection agency epa or agency to cope with a complex problem air pollution emitted in one state,but causing harm in other states.left unregulated,the emitting or upwind state reaps the benefits of the economic activity causing the pollution without bearing all the costs.see revesz,federalism and interstate environmental externalities.conversely,downwind states to which the pollution travels are unable to achieve clean air because of the influx of pollution they lack authority to control.see.to tackle the problem,congress included a good neighbor provision in the clean air act act or caa.that provision,in its current phrasing,instructs states to prohibit sources from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will contribute significantly to downwind states nonattainment,or interfere with maintenance,of any national air quality standard.a d i.
interpreting the good neighbor provision,epa adopted the air pollution rule commonly and hereinafter called the transport rule.the rule calls for consideration of costs,among other factors,when determining the emission reductions an upwind state must make to improve air quality in polluted downwind areas.the court of appeals for the circuit vacated the rule in its entirety.it held,to,that the good neighbor provision requires epa to consider only each upwind state physically proportionate responsibility for each downwind state air quality problem.that reading is demanded,according to the circuit,so that no state will be required to decrease its emissions by more than its ratable share of pollution.
but,the majority objects,the reductions that state x must make to help bring state b into compliance may be more than those necessary for it to help bring state a into compliance,resulting in of x with respect to see ante,at,and.this objection discloses the second flaw in the impossibility theorem.echoing epa,see brief for federal petitioners,the majority believes that the circuit interpretation of the good neighbor provision forbids with respect to even a single downwind receptor.that is the only way in which the approach could be deemed to work neither mathematically nor in practical application on its face.ante,at.but the premise is incorrect.although some of the circuit simplified examples might support that conclusion,its opinion explicitly acknowledged that the complexity of conditions demands the contrary to be sure,there may be some truly unavoidable in some downwind states that occurs as a byproduct of the necessity of reducing upwind states emissions enough to meet the naaqs in other downwind states.moreover,the majority itself recognizes that the good neighbor provision does not categorically prohibit.as the good neighbor provision seeks attainment in every downwind state,exceeding attainment in one state can not rank as unless unnecessary to achieving attainment in any downwind state.ante,at.the majority apparently fails to appreciate that,having cleared up that potential point of confusion,nothing stands in the way of the approach.
congress and the environmental protection agency epa or agency have,over the course of several decades,made many efforts to deal with the complex challenge of curtailing air pollution emitted in upwind states,but causing harm in other,downwind states.as relevant here,the clean air act caa or act directs epa to establish national ambient air quality standards naaqs for pollutants at levels that will protect public health.once epa settles on a naaqs,the agency must designate nonattainment areas,locations where the concentration of a regulated pollutant exceeds the naaqs.d.each state must submit a state implementation plan,or sip,to epa within three years of any new or revised naaqs.a.from the date epa determines that a state sip is inadequate,the agency has two years to promulgate a federal implementation plan,or fip.c.among other components,the caa mandates sip compliance with the good neighbor provision,which requires sips to contain adequate provisions prohibiting any source or other type of emissions activity within the state from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will contribute significantly to nonattainment in,or interfere with maintenance by,any other state with respect to any naaqs.a d i.
several times over the past two decades,epa has attempted to delineate the good neighbor provision scope by identifying when upwind states contribute significantly to nonattainment downwind.the circuit found fault with the agency attempt,the clean air interstate rule,or cair,which regulated both nitrogen oxide nox and sulfur dioxide emissions,the gasses at issue here.the circuit nevertheless left cair temporarily in place,while encouraging epa to act with dispatch in dealing with problems the court had identified.
we agree with the court of appeals to this extent epa can not require a state to reduce its output of pollution by more than is necessary to achieve attainment in every downwind state or at odds with the threshold the agency has set.if epa requires an upwind state to reduce emissions by more than the amount necessary to achieve attainment in every downwind state to which it is linked,the agency will have overstepped its authority,under the good neighbor provision,to eliminate those amounts that contribute to nonattainment.nor can epa demand reductions that would drive an upwind state contribution to every downwind state to which it is linked below one percent of the relevant naaqs.doing so would be counter to step one of the agency interpretation of the good neighbor provision.see fed.reg.s tates whose contributions are below th e thresholds do not significantly contribute to nonattainment of the relevant naaqs.
the circuit stated two further objections to epa method of defining an upwind state contribution.once a state was screened in at step one of epa analysis,its emission budget was calculated solely with reference to the uniform cost thresholds the agency selected at step two.the transport rule thus left open the possibility that a state might be compelled to reduce emissions beyond the point at which every affected downwind state is in attainment,a phenomenon the court of appeals termed at see supra,at.second,epa focus on costs did not foreclose,as the circuit accurately observed,the possibility that an upwind state would be required to reduce its emissions by so much that the state no longer contributed one or more of a relevant naaqs to any downwind state.this would place the state below the mark epa had set,during the screening phase,as the initial threshold of significan ce.see,at,and.
how is epa to divide responsibility among the three states should the agency allocate reductions proportionally ppb each,on a per capita basis,on the basis of the cost of abatement,or by some other metric see brief for federal petitioners noting epa consideration of different approaches.the good neighbor provision does not answer that question for epa.chevron,at t he language of the caa simply does not compel any given interpretation of the term source.under chevron,we read congress silence as a delegation of authority to epa to select from among reasonable options.see united states mead,
yet the court of appeals believed that the act speaks clearly,requiring epa to allocate responsibility for reducing emissions in a manner proportional to each state contributio n to the problem,at.nothing in the text of the good neighbor provision propels epa down this path.understandably so,for as epa notes,the circuit proportionality approach could scarcely be satisfied in practice.see app.in cadc,w hile it is possible to determine an emission reduction percentage if there is a single downwind receptor,most upwind states contribute to multiple downwind receptors in multiple states and would have a different reduction percentage for each one.
to see why,one need only slightly complicate the world envisioned by the dissent.assume the world is made up of only four states two upwind states x and y,and two downwind states a and b.suppose also,as the dissent allows,see post,at,that the reductions state x must make to eliminate its share of the amount by which state a is in nonattainment are more than necessary for state x to eliminate its share of state b nonattainment.as later explained,see infra,at,this kind of we agree with the dissent,is acceptable under the statute.suppose,however,that state y also contributes to pollution in both state a and state b such that the reductions it must make to eliminate its proportion of state b overage exceed the reductions it must make to bring state a into attainment.in this case,the dissent would have state x reduce by just enough to eliminate its share of state a nonattainment and more than enough to eliminate its share of state b overage.the converse will be true as to state y under the dissent approach,state y would have to reduce by the minimum necessary to eliminate its proportional share of state b nonattainment and more than enough to eliminate its proportion of state a overage.the result is that the total amount by which both states x and y are required to reduce will exceed what is necessary for attainment in all downwind states involved,in both state a and state b.thus unnecessary to achieving attainment in all involved states is impermissible under the good neighbor provision.see infra,at.the problem would worsen were the hypothetical altered to include more than two downwind states and two upwind states,the very real circumstances epa must address.
the statutory gap identified also exists in the good neighbor provision second instruction.that instruction requires epa to eliminate amounts of upwind pollution that interfere with maintenance of a naaqs by a downwind state.a d i.this mandate contains no qualifier analogous to significantly,and yet it entails a delegation of administrative authority of the same character as the one discussed above.just as epa is constrained,under the first part of the good neighbor provision,to eliminate only those amounts that contribute to nonattainment,epa is limited,by the second part of the provision,to reduce only by amounts that interfere with maintenance,by just enough to permit an state to maintain satisfactory air quality.emphasis added.with multiple upwind states contributing to the maintenance problem,however,epa confronts the same challenge that the contribute significantly mandate creates how should epa allocate reductions among multiple upwind states,many of which contribute in amounts sufficient to impede downwind maintenance nothing in either clause of the good neighbor provision provides the criteria by which epa is meant to apportion responsibility.
c wholesale invalidation of the transport rule is not justified by either of the circuit remaining objections that the transport rule leaves open the possibility that a state might be compelled to reduce emissions beyond the point at which every affected downwind state is in attainment,and that epa use of costs does not foreclose the possibility that an upwind state would be required to reduce its emissions by so muchthat the state would be placed below the mark epa set as the initial threshold of significan ce.first,instances of in particular downwind locations may be incidental to reductions necessary to ensure attainment elsewhere.as the good neighbor provision seeks attainment in every downwind state,however,exceeding attainment in one state can not rank as unless unnecessary to achieving attainment in any downwind state.second,the epa must have leeway in fulfilling its statutory mandate to balance the possibilities of and to maximize achievement of attainment downwind.finally,in a voluminous record,involving thousands of linkages,respondents point to only a few instances of unnecessary emission reductions,and even those are contested by epa.
b the caa plain text supports the agency disapproval of a sip,without more,triggers epa obligation to issue a fip.the statute sets precise deadlines for the states and epa.once epa issues any new or revised naaqs,a state shall propose a sip within three years,a,and that sip shall include,inter alia,provisions adequate to satisfy the good neighbor provision,a.if the epa finds a sip inadequate,the agency has a statutory duty to issue a fip at any time within two years.c.however sensible the circuit exception to this strict time prescription may be,a reviewing court task is to apply the text of the statute,not to improve upon it.pavelic leflore marvel entertainment group,div.of cadence industries.nothing in the act differentiates the good neighbor provision from the several other matters a state must address in its sip.nor does the act condition the duty to promulgate a fip on epa having first quantified an upwind state good neighbor obligations.by altering congress sip and fip schedule,the circuit allowed a delay congress did not order and placed an information submission obligation on epa congress did not impose.
neither the circuit nor respondents face up to this problem.the dissent,for its part,strains to give meaning to the circuit proportionality constraint as applied to a world in which multiple upwind states contribute emissions to multiple downwind locations.in the dissent view,upwind states must eliminate emissions by whatever minimum amount reduces their share of the overage in each and every one of the downwind states to which they are linked.see post,at.in practical terms,this means each upwind state will be required to reduce emissions by the amount necessary to eliminate that state largest downwind contribution.the dissent formulation,however,does not account for the combined and cumulative effect of each upwind state reductions on attainment in multiple downwind locations.see ibid.under a approach,state x would be required to eliminate emissions of that pollutant by whatever minimum amount reduces both state a level by unit and state b by unit.emphasis added.the result would be costly overregulation unnecessary to,indeed in conflict with,the good neighbor provision goal of attainment.
it is axiomatic that an administrative agency power to promulgate legislative regulations is limited to the authority delegated by congress.bowen georgetown.hospital.yet today the majority treats the text of the clean air act not as the source and ceiling of epa authority to regulate interstate air pollution,but rather as a difficulty to be overcome in pursuit of the agency responsibility to craf t a solution to the problem of interstate air pollution.ante,at.in reality,congress itself has crafted the solution.the good neighbor provision requires each state to eliminate whatever amounts of air pollutant s contribute significantly to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance of national ambient standards naaqs in other states.a d i i.the statute addresses solely the environmental consequences of emissions,not the facility of reducing them and it requires states to shoulder burdens in proportion to the size of their contributions,not in proportion to the ease of bearing them.epa utterly fanciful from each according to its ability construction sacrifices democratically adopted text to bureaucratically favored policy.it deserves no deference under chevron natural resources defense council.
to fill the void created by its abandonment of epa significantly argument,the majority identifies a gap in the text,which epa must fill while the text says that each upwind state must be responsible for its own contribution to downwind pollution,it does not say how responsibility is to be divided among multiple states when the total of their combined contribution to downwind pollution in a particular area exceeds the reduction that the relevant naaqs requires.in the example given by the majority,ante,at,when each of three upwind states contributes units of a pollutant to a downwind state but the reduction required for that state to comply with the naaqs is only units,how will responsibility for that units be apportioned wow,that a hard one almost the equivalent of asking who is buried in grant tomb.if the criterion of responsibility is amounts of pollutants,then surely shared responsibility must be based upon relative amounts of pollutants in the majority example,units for each state.the statute makes no sense otherwise.the good neighbor provision contains a gap only for those who blind themselves to the obvious in order to pursue a preferred policy.
under the transport rule,epa employed a approach to determine when upwind states contribute d significantly to nonattainment,at,and therefore in amounts that had to be eliminated.at step one,called the screening analysis,the agency excluded as de minimis any upwind state that contributed less than one percent of the three to any downwind state receptor,a location at which epa measures air quality.see,at if all of an upwind state contributions fell below the threshold,that state would be considered not to have contribute d significantly to the nonattainment of any downwind state,at.states in that category were screened out and exempted from regulation under the rule.
the majority states that the agency retained discretion to alter its course from the one pursued in the nox sip call and cair,ante,at,but that misses the point.the point is that epa has discretion to arrange things so as to preserve the clean air act core principle of state primacy and that it is an abuse of discretion to refuse to do so.see d a see also a identical text in the administrative procedure act.indeed,the proviso in c that the agency authority to promulgate a fip within the period terminates if the state corrects the deficiency,and epa approves the sip or sip revision explicitly contemplates just such an arrangement.
