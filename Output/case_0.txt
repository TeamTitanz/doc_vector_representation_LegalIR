luna view of described in would substantially undercut that function by excluding from the act coverage all state and foreign versions of any enumerated federal offense that like i contains an interstate commerce element.such an element appears in about half of a listed statutes defining,altogether,serious crimes yet under luna reading,only those federal crimes,and not their state and foreign counterparts,would provide a basis for an alien removal because,as explained earlier,only congress must ever show a link to interstate commerce.see supra,at.no state or foreign legislature needs to incorporate a commerce element to establish its jurisdiction,and so none ever does.accordingly,state and foreign crimes will never precisely replicate a federal statute containing a commerce element.and that means,contrary to a penultimate sentence,that the term aggravated felony would not apply to many of the act listed offenses irrespective of whether they are in violation of federal,state,or foreign law instead,that term would apply exclusively to the federal variants
indeed,luna view would limit the penultimate sentence effect in a peculiarly perverse fashion excluding state and foreign convictions for many of the gravest crimes listed in a,while reaching those convictions for less harmful offenses.consider some of the state and foreign crimes that would not count as aggravated felonies on luna reading because the corresponding federal law has a commerce element most child pornography offenses,including selling a child for the purpose of manufacturing such material,see a i demanding or receiving a ransom for kidnapping,see a h and possessing a firearm after a felony conviction,see a e ii.conversely,the term aggravated felony in luna world would include state and foreign convictions for such comparatively minor offenses as operating an unlawful gambling business,see a j,and possessing a firearm not identified by a serial number,see a e iii,because congress chose,for whatever reason,not to use a commerce element when barring that conduct.and similarly,the term would cover any state or foreign conviction for such nonviolent activity as receiving stolen property,see a g,or forging documents,see a r,because the ina happens to use generic labels to describe those crimes.this court has previously refused to construe a so as to produce such haphazard indeed,coverage.nijhawan holder.we see no reason to follow a different path here congress would not have placed an alien convicted by a state of running an illegal casino at greater risk of removal than one found guilty under the same state law of selling a child
in an attempt to make some sense of his reading,luna posits that congress might have believed that crimes having an interstate connection are generally more serious than those lacking one for example,that interstate child pornography is worse than the intrastate variety.brief for petitioner.but to begin with,that theory can not explain the set of results just described not even luna maintains that congress thought local acts of selling a child,receiving explosives,or demanding a ransom are categorically less serious than,say,operating an unlawful casino or receiving stolen property whether or not in interstate commerce.and it is scarcely more plausible to view an interstate commerce element in any given offense as separating serious from conduct why,for example,would congress see an alien who carried out a kidnapping for ransom wholly within a state as materially less dangerous than one who crossed state lines in committing that crime the essential harm of the crime is the same irrespective of state borders.luna argument thus misconceives the function of interstate commerce elements rather than distinguishing greater from lesser evils,they serve as earlier explained to connect a given substantive offense to one of congress enumerated powers.see supra,at.and still more fundamentally,luna account runs counter to the penultimate sentence central message that the national,local,or foreign character of a crime has no bearing on whether it is grave enough to warrant an alien automatic removal
luna and the dissent,see post,at must therefore fall back on a different defense that his approach would exclude from the universe of aggravated felonies fewer serious state and foreign offenses than one might think.to make that argument,luna relies primarily on a part of the act specifying that the term aggravated felony shall include a crime of violence as defined in for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.a f see defining crime of violence as involving the use of physical force against the person or property of another.according to luna,many state and foreign offenses failing to match the act listed federal statutes for want of an interstate commerce element would count as crimes of violence and,by that alternative route,trigger automatic removal.a different statutory phrase,or so luna says,would thus plug the holes opened by his construction of the described in provisions.
the majority first example,ante,at,is the assimilative crimes act,a,a statute that incorporates state criminal law into federal enclaves if the act or omission is not made punishable by any enactment of congress but would be punishable if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the state.the court held that,in identifying such a gap,courts should ignore jurisdictional,or other technical,differences between a state and federal statute.lewis united states.but the way courts match the elements of a state law to a federal analog under the assimilative crimes act differs fundamentally from our ina inquiry.the basic question under the assimilative crimes act is whether federal statutes reveal an intent to occupy so much of the field as would exclude the use of the particular state statute at issue.at.under the assimilative crimes act,the state statute is not compared to a single federal statute,but rather to a complex of federal statutes that roughly cover the same general conduct and policies.ibid.that statute thus has little to teach us about a in interpreting the assimilative crimes act,every member of the court rejected the simple approach that the court generally employs to construe the aggravated felony provisions of the ina.see,at kennedy,dissenting allowing slight differences in definition between federal and state statute and using inquiry only as a starting point
the majority analogy to the federal three strikes statute,c f,ante,at,is similarly unhelpful.that provision counts as a predicate serious violent felony any federal or state offense wherever committed,consisting of various crimes,including several as described in federal statutes.ante,at.emphasis added.though this court has not construed the statute,the majority notes that courts of appeals disregard the jurisdictional element of federal statutes in assessing whether a state conviction is for a serious violent felony.ante,at.but nearly all of the statutes listed in c f contain jurisdiction elements the crime must take place within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states,b,or within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the united states,and so on.in the two cases cited by the majority,for instance,ante,at,courts of appeals concluded that a state robbery offense qualified as an offense described in the federal bank robbery statute even though the robbery did not take place in a bank.see united states wicks,united states.in that statute,it is the wherever committed,not some loose construction of described in,that specifically instructs the courts that the location where a crime occurs does not matter.
the issue in this case arises because of the distinctive role interstate commerce elements play in federal criminal law.in our federal system,congress can not punish felonies generally,cohens virginia,wheat,it may enact only those criminal laws that are connected to one of its constitutionally enumerated powers,such as the authority to regulate interstate commerce.as a result,most federal offenses include,in addition to substantive elements,a jurisdictional one,like the interstate commerce requirement of i.the substantive elements primarily define the behavior that the statute calls a violation of federal law,scheidler national organization for women,or,as the model penal code puts the point,they relate to the harm or evil the law seeks to prevent.the jurisdictional element,by contrast,ties the substantive offense here,arson to one of congress constitutional powers here,its authority over interstate commerce,thus spelling out the warrant for congress to legislate.see,at explaining that congress intends such statutory terms as affect commerce or in commerce as terms of art connecting the congressional exercise of legislative authority with the constitutional provision here,the commerce clause that grants congress that authority
for obvious reasons,state criminal laws do not include the jurisdictional elements common in federal statutes state legislatures,exercising their plenary police powers,are not limited to congress enumerated powers and so states have no reason to tie their substantive offenses to those grants of authority.see,united states lopez.in particular,state crimes do not contain interstate commerce elements because a state does not need such a jurisdictional hook.accordingly,even state offenses whose substantive elements match up exactly with a federal law will part ways with respect to interstate commerce.that slight discrepancy creates the issue here if a state offense lacks an interstate commerce element but otherwise mirrors one of the federal statutes listed in a,does the state crime count as an aggravated felony or,alternatively,does the jurisdictional difference reflected in the state and federal laws preclude that result,no matter the laws substantive correspondence
both parties begin with the statutory text most directly at issue,disputing when a state offense here,arson is described in an enumerated federal statute here,i.luna,armed principally with black law dictionary,argues that described in means expressed or set forth in which,he says,requires the state offense to include each one of the federal law elements.brief for petitioner the government,brandishing dictionaries of its own,contends that the statutory phrase has a looser meaning that describing entails not precise replication,but convey ance of an idea or impression or of a thing central features.brief for respondent on that view,described in,as opposed to the more precise defined in sometimes found in statutes,denotes that the state offense need only incorporate the federal law core,substantive elements.
and lower courts have uniformly adopted the same approach when comparing federal and state crimes in order to apply the federal statute.that law imposes mandatory life imprisonment on a person convicted on three separate occasions of a serious violent felony.c.sounding very much like the ina,the statute defines such a felony to include a federal or state offense,by whatever designation and wherever committed,consisting of specified crimes,murder,manslaughter,robbery as described in listed federal criminal statutes.c f.in deciding whether a state crime of conviction thus corresponds to an enumerated federal statute,every court to have faced the issue has ignored the statute jurisdictional element.see,united states,per curiam united states wicks.judge wood,writing for the seventh circuit,highlighted the phrase a federal or state offense,by whatever designation and wherever committed the law version of a penultimate sentence.it is hard to see why congress would have used this language,she reasoned,if it had meant that every detail of the federal offense,including its jurisdictional element,had to be replicated in the state offense.at.just so,too,in the ina whose aggravated felony provisions operate against,and rely on,an established legal backdrop distinguishing between jurisdictional and substantive elements
luna objects to drawing that line on the ground that it is too hard to tell the difference between the two.see brief for petitioner discussing,in particular,statutes criminalizing the destruction of federal property and sending threats via the postal service.but that contention collides with the judicial experience just described.courts regularly separate substantive from jurisdictional elements in applying federal criminal statutes mens rea requirements so too in implementing other laws that require a comparison of federal and state offenses.and from all we can see,courts perform that task with no real trouble luna has not pointed to any divisions between or within circuits arising from the practice.we do not deny that some tough questions may lurk on the margins where an element that makes evident congress regulatory power also might play a role in defining the behavior congress thought harmful.but a standard interstate commerce element,of the kind appearing in a great many federal laws,is almost always a simple jurisdictional hook and courts may as easily acknowledge that fact in enforcing the ina as they have done in other contexts.
luna makes a final argument opposing our reading of a if congress had meant for ordinary crimes like arson to count as aggravated felonies,it would have drafted the provision to make that.brief for petitioner.congress,luna submits,would have used the generic term for those crimes,arson rather than demanding that the state law of conviction correspond to a listed federal statute.see,at.or else,luna and the dissent suggests,see,at post,at,congress would have expressly distinguished between substantive and jurisdictional elements,as it did in an unrelated law mandating the pretrial detention of any person convicted of a federal offense described in a certain federal statute,or of a state or local offense that would have been an offense described in that statute if a circumstance giving rise to federal jurisdiction had existed,e a.
but as an initial matter,congress may have had good reason to think that a statutory reference would capture more accurately than a generic label the range of state convictions warranting automatic deportation.the clause of a applying to luna case well illustrates the point.by referring to i,that provision incorporates not only the arson offenses that a generic arson label would cover,but various explosives offenses too.see brief for petitioner,conceding that had congress used the term arson,it would have had to separately identify the explosives crimes encompassed in i.and the elements of generic arson are themselves so uncertain as to pose problems for a court having to decide whether they are present in a given state law.see poulos,the metamorphosis of the law of arson,describing multiple conflicts over what conduct the term arson includes.nor is the clause at issue here unusual in those respects section a includes many other statutory references that do not convert easily to generic labels.see,a e ii listing federal statutes defining various firearms offenses.to be sure,congress used such labels to describe some crimes qualifying as aggravated felonies for example,murder,rape,or sexual abuse of a minor.a a.but what is good for some crimes is not for others.the use of a federal statutory reference shows only that congress thought it the best way to identify certain substantive crimes not that congress wanted in conflict with the penultimate sentence to exclude state and foreign versions of those offenses for lack of a jurisdictional element.
luna argument does not reassure us.we agree that state counterparts of some enumerated federal offenses would qualify as aggravated felonies through the crime of violence provision.but not nearly all such offenses,and not even the worst ones.consider again some of the listed offenses described earlier.see supra,at.the crime of violence provision would not pick up demanding a ransom for kidnapping.see a defining the crime without any reference to physical force.it would not cover most of the listed child pornography offenses,involving the distribution,receipt,and possession of such materials.it would not reach laws and other firearms offenses.and indeed,it would not reach arson in the many states defining that crime to include the destruction of one own property.see jordison gonzales,holding that a violation of california arson statute does not count as a crime of violence for that reason tr.of oral arg.solicitor general agreeing with that interpretation so under luna reading,state and foreign counterparts to a broad swath of listed statutes would remain outside a coverage merely because they lack an explicit interstate commerce connection.and for all the reasons discussed above,that result would significantly restrict the penultimate sentence force and effect,and in an utterly random manner
just as important,a settled practice of distinguishing between substantive and jurisdictional elements of federal criminal laws supports reading a to include state analogues lacking an interstate commerce requirement.as already explained,the substantive elements of a federal statute describe the evil congress seeks to prevent the jurisdictional element connects the law to one of congress enumerated powers,thus establishing legislative authority.see supra,at ali,model penal code.both kinds of elements must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt and because that is so,both may play a real role in a criminal case.but still,they are not created equal for every purpose.to the contrary,courts have often recognized including when comparing federal and state offenses that congress uses substantive and jurisdictional elements for different reasons and does not expect them to receive identical treatment.
the ina makes any alien convicted of an aggravated felony after entering the united states deportable.see a a iii.such an alien is also ineligible for several forms of discretionary relief,including cancellation of removal an order allowing a deportable alien to remain in the country.see a.and because of his felony,the alien faces expedited removal proceedings.see a a.
the act defines the term aggravated felony by way of a long list of offenses,now codified at a.in all,that provision subparagraphs enumerate some different crimes.in more than half of those subparagraphs,congress specified the crimes by citing particular federal statutes.according to that common formulation,an offense is an aggravated felony if it is described in,say,relating to child pornography,g relating to unlawful gun possession,or,of particular relevance here,i relating to arson and explosives.a e,i.most of the remaining subparagraphs refer to crimes by their generic labels,stating that an offense is an aggravated felony if,for example,it is murder,rape,or sexual abuse of a minor.a a.following the entire list of crimes,a penultimate sentence reads the term aggravated felony applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of federal or state law and applies to such an offense in violation of the law of a foreign country for which the term of imprisonment was completed within the previous years.so,putting aside the curlicue,the penultimate sentence provides that an offense listed in a is an aggravated felony whether in violation of federal,state,or foreign law.
the immigration and nationality act ina or act imposes certain adverse immigration consequences on an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.the ina defines that term by listing various crimes,most of which are identified as offenses described in specified provisions of the federal criminal code.immediately following that list,the act provides that the referenced offenses are aggravated felonies irrespective of whether they are in violation of federal,state,or foreign law.stat,a.in this case,we must decide if a state crime counts as an aggravated felony when it corresponds to a specified federal offense in all ways but one namely,the state crime lacks the interstate commerce element used in the federal statute to establish legislative jurisdiction,congress power to enact the law.we hold that the absence of such a jurisdictional element is immaterial a state crime of that kind is an aggravated felony.
the board of immigration appeals board affirmed,based on a comparison of the federal and new york arson statutes.see,at.the ina,as just noted,provides that an offense described in i,the federal arson and explosives statute,is an aggravated felony.section i,in turn,makes it a crime to maliciously damage or destroy,or attempt to damage or destroy,by means of fire or an explosive,any building or vehicle used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce.for its part,the new york law that luna was convicted under prohibits intentionally damag ing,or attempting to damage,a building or motor vehicle by starting a fire or causing an explosion.penal law ann,west.the state law,the board explained,thus matches the federal statute with one exception the new york law does not require a connection to interstate commerce.according to the board,that single difference did not matter because the federal statute commerce element is jurisdictional that is,its function is to establish congress power to legislate.see app.to pet for cert.given that the two laws substantive,elements map onto each other,the board held,the new york arson offense is described in i.
the court of appeals for the second circuit denied luna petition for review of the board ruling.see.the court decision added to a circuit split over whether a state offense is an aggravated felony when it has all the elements of a listed federal crime except one requiring a connection to interstate commerce we granted certiorari.
section a penultimate sentence,as noted above,provides the term aggravated felony applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of federal or state law and applies to such an offense in violation of the law of a foreign country for which the term of imprisonment was completed within the previous years.see supra,at.that sentence except for the time limit on foreign convictions declares the source of criminal law irrelevant the listed offenses count as aggravated felonies regardless of whether they are made illegal by the federal government,a state,or a foreign country.that is true of the crimes identified by reference to federal statutes as here,an offense described in i,as well as those employing generic labels for example,murder.as even luna recognizes,state and foreign analogues of the enumerated federal crimes qualify as aggravated felonies.see brief for petitioner contesting only what properly counts as such an analogue.the whole point of a penultimate sentence is to make clear that a listed offense should lead to swift removal,no matter whether it violates federal,state,or foreign law.
that overlapping structure is apparent throughout the ina.first,the aggravated felony list itself has multiple provisions.most serious offenses,for instance,will qualify as crime s of violence for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year,a f,even if they are not covered by a more specific provision in the aggravated felony list.had his crime been charged as a more serious arson and had he been punished by one year of imprisonment instead of one day,luna might have qualified as an aggravated felon under that provision.see santana holder,arson in new york is a crime of violence
second,other sections of the ina provide intertwining coverage for serious crimes.some examples of provisions that encompass many offenses include those for the commission of a crime involving moral turpitude,a firearms offense,or a controlled substance offense,all of which will render a noncitizen removable,even if he or she has not committed an aggravated felony.see a a i,b i,c a a i ii.judulang holder,commenting on the breadth of the crime involving moral turpitude provision
and finally,in luna case or anyone else,the attorney general can exercise her discretion to deny relief to a serious criminal whether or not that criminal has been convicted of an aggravated felony.see,at doubting that a narrow reading of a will have any practical effect on policing our nation borders
to be sure,on luna reading,some serious conduct may not be captured by the ina.but not nearly so much as the majority suggests.by contrast,once the aggravated felony statute applies to a noncitizen,no provision in the ina and virtually no act by the attorney general can prevent him or her from being removed.
it is true that,on luna reading,some of the aggravated felonies listed in the ina including an offense described in i will have no state or foreign analog.but the proviso still applies to generic offenses,which constitute nearly half of the entries in the aggravated felony list.see,a a,g,m i.and that portion jumps to close to of the offenses after counting those many listed federal statutes with no jurisdictional element.see,a c,e ii,j.in fact,it applies to the vast majority of offenses adjudicated under the ina given that most serious crimes are also crimes of violence.see a f
and the majority must admit that its interpretation will also leave entries in the section with no state or foreign analogs.for instance,it seems unlikely that the proviso contemplates state analogs for the aggravated felony provisions regarding treason,levying war against the united states,or disclosing national defense information.see a l i,p.
but neither of those claims about the bare term described in can resolve this case.like many words,describe takes on different meanings in different contexts.consider two ways in which this court has used the word.in one case,describe conveyed exactness a contractual provision,we wrote,describes the subject matter with great particularity,giv ing the precise number of pounds of tobacco,the tax for which each pound was liable,and the aggregate of the tax.ryan united states,wall.in another case,not the disclosure provision is meant,we stated,to describe the law to consumers in a manner that is concise and comprehensible to the layman which necessarily means that it will be imprecise.compucredit greenwood.so staring at,or even looking up,the words described in can not answer whether a state offense must replicate every last element of a listed federal statute,including its jurisdictional one,to qualify as an aggravated felony.in considering that issue,we must,as usual,interpret the relevant words not in a vacuum,but with reference to the statutory context.abramski united states,slip,at
here,two contextual considerations decide the matter.the first is a penultimate sentence,which shows that congress meant the term aggravated felony to capture serious crimes regardless of whether they are prohibited by federal,state,or foreign law.the second is a background principle distinguishing between substantive and jurisdictional elements in federal criminal statutes.we address each factor in turn.
the majority first perceives a conflict between luna reading of the ina and what it calls the penultimate sentence of the aggravated felony statute.the penultimate sentence provides that an offense can be an aggravated felony whether in violation of federal or state law or in violation of the law of a foreign country.a.the majority claims that luna reading of the ina would vitiate the quoted proviso.ante,at.
still more strikingly,courts have distinguished between the two kinds of elements in contexts,similar to this one,in which the judicial task is to compare federal and state offenses.the assimilative crimes act aca,a,subjects federal enclaves,like military bases,to state criminal laws except when they punish the same conduct as a federal statute.the aca thus requires courts to decide when a federal and a state law are sufficiently alike that only the federal one will apply.and we have held that,in making that assessment,courts should ignore jurisdictional elements when the differences among elements of the state and federal crimes reflect jurisdictional,or other technical,considerations alone,then the state law will have no effect in the area.lewis united states,see also,at kennedy,dissenting agreeing that courts should look beyond jurisdictional elements,and focus only on substantive ones,in determining whether the elements of the two crimes are the same in such a case,we reasoned just as we do now that congress meant for the federal jurisdictional element to be set aside.
