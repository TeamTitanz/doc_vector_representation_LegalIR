the clean water act regulates the discharge of any pollutant into the waters of the united states.a.when property contains such waters,landowners who discharge pollutants without a permit from the army corps of engineers risk substantial criminal and civil penalties,c,d,while those who do apply for a permit face a process that is often arduous,expensive,and long.it can be difficult to determine in the first place,however,whether waters of the united states are present.during the time period relevant to this case,for example,the corps defined that term to include all wetlands,the use,degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate or foreign commerce.cfr a.because of that difficulty,the corps allows property owners to obtain a standalone jurisdictional determination jd specifying whether a particular property contains waters of the united states.a jd may be either preliminary,advising a property owner that such waters may be present,or approved,definitively stating the presence or absence of such waters.ibid.an approved jd is considered an administratively appealable final agency action,a,and is binding for five years on both the corps and the environmental protection agency,cfr pt,app.c epa,memorandum of agreement exemptions under section f of the clean water act.
the corps does not dispute that an approved jd satisfies the first bennett condition.unlike preliminary jds which are advisory in nature and simply indicate that there may be waters of the united states on a parcel of property,cfr an approved jd clearly mark s the consummation of the corps decisionmaking process on that question,bennett,at internal quotation marks omitted.it is issued after extensive factfinding by the corps regarding the physical and hydrological characteristics of the property,see army corps of engineers,jurisdictional determination form instructional guidebook,and is typically not revisited if the permitting process moves forward.indeed,the corps itself describes approved jds as final agency action,see cfr a,and specifies that an approved jd will remain valid for a period of five years,corps,regulatory guidance letter,a,june,guidance letter see also cfr pt,app.
respondents,three companies engaged in mining peat,sought a permit from the corps to discharge material onto wetlands located on property that respondents own and hope to mine.in connection with the permitting process,respondents obtained an approved jd from the corps stating that the property contained waters of the united states because its wetlands had a significant nexus to the red river of the north,located some miles away.after exhausting administrative remedies,respondents sought review of the approved jd in federal district court under the administrative procedure act apa,but the district court dismissed for want of jurisdiction,holding that the revised jd was not a final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court,the eighth circuit reversed.
the clean water act regulates the discharge of pollutants into the waters of the united states.a.because it can be difficult to determine whether a particular parcel of property contains such waters,the army corps of engineers will issue to property owners an approved jurisdictional determination stating the agency definitive view on that matter.see cfr and pt,app.c.the question presented is whether that determination is final agency action judicially reviewable under the administrative procedure act.
an approved jd satisfies bennett first condition.it clearly mark s the consummation of the corps decisionmaking on the question whether a particular property does or does not contain waters of the united states.it is issued after extensive factfinding by the corps regarding the physical and hydrological characteristics of the property,see army corps of engineers,jurisdictional determination form instructional guidebook,and typically remains valid for a period of five years,see cfr pt,app.c.the corps itself describes approved jds as final agency action.id.a.
the definitive nature of approved jds also gives rise to direct and appreciable legal consequences,thereby satisfying the second prong of bennett,at.consider the effect of an approved jd stating that a party property does not contain jurisdictional waters a negative jd,in corps parlance.as noted,such a jd will generally bind the corps for five years.see cfr pt,app.c guidance letter.under a longstanding memorandum of agreement between the corps and epa,it will also be binding on the government and represent the government position in any subsequent federal action or litigation concerning that final determination.memorandum of agreement.a negative jd thus binds the two agencies authorized to bring civil enforcement proceedings under the clean water act,see,creating a safe harbor from such proceedings for a property owner.additionally,although the property owner may still face a citizen suit under the act,such a suit unlike actions brought by the government can not impose civil liability for wholly past violations.see d,a gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay foundation.in other words,a negative jd both narrows the field of potential plaintiffs and limits the potential liability a landowner faces for discharging pollutants without a permit.each of those effects is a legal consequence satisfying the second bennett prong,at see also sackett,at.
the corps specifies whether particular property contains waters of the united states by issuing jurisdictional determinations jds on a basis.jds come in two varieties preliminary and approved.ibid.while preliminary jds merely advise a property owner that there may be waters of the united states on a parcel,approved jds definitively stat e the presence or absence of such waters.ibid.emphasis added.unlike preliminary jds,approved jds can be administratively appealed and are defined by regulation to constitute a corps final agency action.a.they are binding for five years on both the corps and the environmental protection agency,which share authority to enforce the clean water act.see,s cfr pt,app.c epa,memorandum of agreement exemptions under section f of the clean water act memorandum of agreement.
b a final agency action is reviewable under the apa only if there are no adequate alternatives to apa review in court.the corps contends that respondents have two such alternatives they may proceed without a permit and argue in a government enforcement action that a permit was not required,or they may complete the permit process and then seek judicial review,which,the corps suggests,is what congress envisioned.neither alternative is adequate.parties need not await enforcement proceedings before challenging final agency action where such proceedings carry the risk of serious criminal and civil penalties.abbott,at.and the permitting process is not only costly and lengthy,but also irrelevant to the finality of the approved jd and its suitability for judicial review.furthermore,because the clean water act makes no reference to standalone jurisdictional determinations,there is little basis for inferring anything from it concerning their reviewability.given the apa presumption of reviewability for all final agency action,sackett epa,t he mere fact that permitting decisions are reviewable is insufficient to imply exclusion as to other agency actions,such as approved jds,abbott,at.
the clean water act prohibits the discharge of any pollutant without a permit into navigable waters,which it defines,in turn,as the waters of the united states.a.during the time period relevant to this case,the army corps of engineers defined the waters of the united states to include land areas occasionally or regularly saturated with water such as mudflats,sandflats,wetlands,sloughs,prairie potholes,wet meadows,and playa lakes the use,degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate or foreign commerce.cfr a.the corps has applied that definition to assert jurisdiction over million acres of swampy lands in the united states including half of alaska and an area the size of california in the lower states.rapanos united states,plurality opinion.
in february,in connection with the permitting process,the corps issued an approved jd stating that the property contained water of the united states because its wetlands had a significant nexus to the red river of the north,located some miles away,at.respondents appealed the jd to the corps mississippi valley division commander,who remanded for further factfinding.on remand,the corps reaffirmed its original conclusion and issued a revised jd to that effect,at app.to pet.for cert.
respondents then sought judicial review of the revised jd under the administrative procedure act apa,et.the district court dismissed for want of subject matter jurisdiction,holding that the revised jd was not final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court,as required by the apa prior to judicial review.supp.the court of appeals for the eighth circuit reversed,and we granted certiorari.
the definitive nature of approved jds also gives rise to direct and appreciable legal consequences,thereby satisfying bennett second condition as well,at.a negative jd,an approved jd stating that property does not contain jurisdictional waters creates a safe harbor from civil enforcement proceedings brought by the government and limits the potential liability a property owner faces for violating the clean water act.see,a.each of those effects is a legal consequence.it follows that an affirmative jd,like the one issued here,also has legal consequences it deprives property owners of the safe harbor that negative jds afford.this conclusion tracks the pragmatic approach the court has long taken to finality.abbott laboratories gardner.
this conclusion tracks the pragmatic approach we have long taken to finality.abbott laboratories gardner.for example,in frozen food express united states,we considered the finality of an order specifying which commodities the interstate commerce commission believed were exempt by statute from regulation,and which it believed were not.although the order had no authority except to give notice of how the commission interpreted the relevant statute,and would have effect only if and when a particular action was brought against a particular carrier,abbott,at,we held that the order was nonetheless immediately reviewable,frozen food,at.the order,we explained,warns every carrier,who does not have authority from the commission to transport those commodities,that it does so at the risk of incurring criminal penalties.at.so too here,while no administrative or criminal proceeding can be brought for failure to conform to the approved jd itself,that final agency determination not only deprives respondents of a safe harbor from liability under the act,but warns that if they discharge pollutants onto their property without obtaining a permit from the corps,they do so at the risk of significant criminal and civil pena
it is often difficult to determine whether a particular piece of property contains waters of the united states,but there are important consequences if it does.the clean water act imposes substantial criminal and civil penalties for discharging any pollutant into waters covered by the act without a permit from the corps.see a,c,d,a.the costs of obtaining such a permit are significant.for a specialized individual permit of the sort at issue in this case,for example,one study found that the average applicant spends days and in completing the process,without counting costs of mitigation or design changes.rapanos,at.even more readily available general permits took applicants,on average,days and to complete.ibid.see generally cfr h limiting general permits to activities that cause only minimal individual and cumulative environmental impacts.
a in general,two conditions must be satisfied for an agency action to be final under the apa first,the action must mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking process,and second,the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined,or from which legal consequences will flow.bennett spear.
