the board argument that entities designated by the states as agencies are exempt from midcal second requirement can not be reconciled with the court repeated conclusion that the need for supervision turns not on the formal designation given by states to regulators but on the risk that active market participants will pursue private interests in restraining trade.state agencies controlled by active market participants pose the very risk of midcal supervision requirement was created to address.see goldfarb virginia state bar.this conclusion does not question the good faith of state officers but rather is an assessment of the structural risk of market participants confusing their own interests with the state policy goals.while hallie stated it is likely that active state supervision would also not be required for agencies,at,the entity there was more like prototypical state agencies,not specialized boards dominated by active market participants.the latter are similar to private trade associations vested by states with regulatory authority,which must satisfy midcal active supervision standard,at.the similarities between agencies controlled by active market participants and such associations are not eliminated simply because the former are given a formal designation by the state,vested with a measure of government power,and required to follow some procedural rules.see hallie,supra,at.when a state empowers a group of active market participants to decide who can participate in its market,and on what terms,the need for supervision is manifest.thus,the court holds today that a state board on which a controlling number of decisionmakers are active market participants in the occupation the board regulates must satisfy midcal active supervision requirement in order to invoke antitrust immunity.
an entity may not invoke parker immunity unless its actions are an exercise of the state sovereign power.see columbia omni outdoor advertising.thus,where a state delegates control over a market to a nonsovereign actor the sherman act confers immunity only if the state accepts political accountability for the anticompetitive conduct it permits and controls.limits on immunity are most essential when a state seeks to delegate its regulatory power to active market participants,for dual allegiances are not always apparent to an actor and prohibitions against anticompetitive by active market participants are an axiom of federal antitrust policy.accordingly,parker immunity requires that the anticompetitive conduct of nonsovereign actors,especially those authorized by the state to regulate their own profession,result from procedures that suffice to make it the state own.midcal test provides a proper analytical framework to resolve the ultimate question whether an anticompetitive policy is indeed the policy of a state.the first requirement clear articulation rarely will achieve that goal by itself,for entities purporting to act under state authority might diverge from the state considered definition of the public good and engage in private.the second midcal requirement active supervision seeks to avoid this harm by requiring the state to review and approve interstitial policies made by the entity claiming immunity.
in this case the board argues its members were invested by north carolina with the power of the state and that,as a result,the board actions are cloaked with parker immunity.this argument fails,however.a nonsovereign actor controlled by active market participants such as the board enjoys parker immunity only if it satisfies two requirements first that the challenged restraint be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy,and second that the policy be actively supervised by the state.ftc phoebe putney health system,slip,at quoting california retail liquor dealers midcal aluminum.the parties have assumed that the clear articulation requirement is satisfied,and we do the same.while north carolina prohibits the unauthorized practice of dentistry,however,its act is silent on whether that broad prohibition covers teeth whitening.here,the board did not receive active by the state when it interpreted the act as teeth whitening and when it enforced that policy by issuing letters to nondentist teeth whiteners.
the board does not contend in this court that its anticompetitive conduct was actively supervised by the state or that it should receive parker immunity on that basis.the act delegates control over the practice of dentistry to the board,but says nothing about teeth whitening.in acting to expel the dentists competitors from the market,the board relied on letters threatening criminal liability,instead of other powers at its disposal that would have invoked oversight by a politically accountable official.whether or not the board exceeded its powers under north carolina law,there is no evidence of any decision by the state to initiate or concur with the board actions against the nondentists.
by statute,north carolina delegates control over the practice of dentistry to the board.the act,however,says nothing about teeth whitening,a practice that did not exist when it was passed.after receiving complaints from other dentists about the nondentists cheaper services,the board dentist members some of whom offered whitening services acted to expel the dentists competitors from the market.in so doing the board relied upon letters threatening criminal liability,rather than any of the powers at its disposal that would invoke oversight by a politically accountable official.with no active supervision by the state,north carolina officials may well have been unaware that the board had decided teeth whitening constitutes the practice of dentistry and sought to prohibit those who competed against dentists from participating in the teeth whitening market.whether or not the board exceeded its powers under north carolina law,omni,at,there is no evidence here of any decision by the state to initiate or concur with the board actions against the nondentists.
c here,where there are no specific supervisory systems to be reviewed,it suffices to note that the inquiry regarding active supervision is flexible and.the question is whether the state review mechanisms provide realistic assurance that a nonsovereign actor anticompetitive conduct promotes state policy,rather than merely the party individual interests.patrick.the court has identified only a few constant requirements of active supervision the supervisor must review the substance of the anticompetitive decision,see,at the supervisor must have the power to veto or modify particular decisions to ensure they accord with state policy,see and the mere potential for state supervision is not an adequate substitute for a decision by the state,ticor,supra,at.further,the state supervisor may not itself be an active market participant.in general,however,the adequacy of supervision otherwise will depend on all the circumstances of a case.
the federal trade commission ftc filed an administrative complaint,alleging that the board concerted action to exclude nondentists from the market for teeth whitening services in north carolina constituted an anticompetitive and unfair method of competition under the federal trade commission act.an administrative law judge alj denied the board motion to dismiss on the ground of immunity.the ftc sustained that ruling,reasoning that even if the board had acted pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy to displace competition,the board must be actively supervised by the state to claim immunity,which it was not.after a hearing on the merits,the alj determined that the board had unreasonably restrained trade in violation of antitrust law.the ftc again sustained the alj,and the fourth circuit affirmed the ftc in all respects.
the state argues that allowing this ftc order to stand will discourage dedicated citizens from serving on state agencies that regulate their own occupation.but this holding is not inconsistent with the idea that those who pursue a calling must embrace ethical standards that derive from a duty separate from the dictates of the state.further,this case does not offer occasion to address the question whether agency officials,including board members,may,under some circumstances,enjoy immunity from damages liability.of course,states may provide for the defense and indemnification of agency members in the event of litigation,and they can also ensure parker immunity is available by adopting clear policies to displace competition and providing active supervision.arguments against the wisdom of applying the antitrust laws to professional regulation absent compliance with the prerequisites for invoking parker immunity must be rejected,see patrick burget,particularly in light of the risks licensing boards dominated by market participants may pose to the free market.
to further that end,the legislature created the north carolina state board of dental examiners as the agency of the state for the regulation of the practice of dentistry in th e state.b.
when the basis for the parker doctrine is understood,the court error in this case is plain.in,the regulation of the practice of medicine and dentistry was regarded as falling squarely within the states sovereign police power.by that time,many states had established medical and dental boards,often staffed by doctors or dentists and had given those boards the authority to confer and revoke licenses this was quintessential police power legislation,and although state laws were often challenged during that era under the doctrine of substantive due process,the licensing of medical professionals easily survived such assaults.just one year before the enactment of the sherman act,in dent west,this court rejected such a challenge to a state law requiring all physicians to obtain a certificate from the state board of health attesting to their qualifications.and in hawker new york,the court reiterated that a lawspecifying the qualifications to practice medicine was clearly a proper exercise of the police power.thus,the north carolina statutes establishing and specifying the powers of the state board of dental examiners represent precisely the kind of state regulation that the parker exemption was meant to immunize.
today,however,the court takes the unprecedented step of holding that parker does not apply to the north board because the board is not structured in a way that merits a seal of approval that is,it is made up of practicing dentists who have a financial incentive to use the licensing laws to further the financial interests of the state dentists.there is nothing new about the structure of the north carolina board.when the states first created medical and dental boards,well before the sherman act was enacted,they began to staffthem in this way nor is there anything new about the suspicion that the north carolina board in attempting to prevent persons other than dentists from performing procedures was serving the interests of dentists and not the public.professional and occupational licensing requirements have often been used in such a way but that is not what parker immunity is about.indeed,the very state program involved in that case was unquestionably designed to benefit the regulated entities,california raisin growers.
in,the federal trade commission ftc filed an administrative complaint charging the board with violating of the federal trade commission act,stat,as amended.the ftc alleged that the board concerted action to exclude nondentists from the market for teeth whitening services in north carolina constituted an anticompetitive and unfair method of competition.the board moved to dismiss,alleging immunity.an administrative law judge alj denied the motion.on appeal,the ftc sustained the alj ruling.it reasoned that,even assuming the board had acted pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy to displace competition,the board is a hybrid that must be actively supervised by the state to claim immunity.app.to pet.for cert.the ftc further concluded the board could not make that showing.
the court decision in this case is based on a serious misunderstanding of the doctrine of antitrust immunity that this court recognized more than years ago in parker brown.in parker,the court held that the sherman act does not prevent the states from continuing their practice of enacting measures,such as licensing requirements,that are designed to protect the public health and welfare,at.the case now before us involves precisely this type of state regulation north carolina laws governing the practice of dentistry,which are administered by the north carolina board of dental examiners board.
limits on immunity are most essential when the state seeks to delegate its regulatory power to active market participants,for established ethical standards may blend with private anticompetitive motives in a way difficult even for market participants to discern.dual allegiances are not always apparent to an actor.in consequence,active market participants can not be allowed to regulate their own markets free from antitrust.see midcal,supra,at the national policy in favor of competition can not be thwarted by casting a gauzy cloak of state involvement over what is essentially a private arrangement indeed,prohibitions against anticompetitive by active market participants are an axiom of federal antitrust policy.see,allied tube conduit indian head,hoover,supra,at stevens,dissenting the risk that private regulation of market entry,prices,or output may be designed to confer profits on members of an industry at the expense of the consuming public has been the central concern of our antitrust jurisprudence see also elhauge,the scope of antitrust process,harv.so it follows that,under parker and the supremacy clause,the states greater power to attain an end does not include the lesser power to negate the congressional judgment embodied in the sherman act through unsupervised delegations to active market participants.see garland,antitrust and state action economic efficiency and the political process,yale.
omni holding makes it all the more necessary to ensure the conditions for granting immunity are met in the first place.the court two immunity cases decided after omni reinforce this point.in ticor the court affirmed that midcal limits on delegation must ensure that a ctual state involvement,not deference to private arrangements under the general auspices of state law,is the precondition for immunity from federal law.at.and in phoebe putney the court observed that midcal active supervision requirement,in particular,is an essential condition of immunity when a nonsovereign actor has an incentive to pursue its own under the guise of implementing state policies.at slip,at quoting hallie,supra,at.the lesson is clear midcal active supervision test is an essential prerequisite of parker immunity for any nonsovereign entity public or private controlled by active market participants.
