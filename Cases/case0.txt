any alien convict of a aggravate felony after enter the united states be deportable ineligible for several form of discretionary relief and subject to expedited removal a a iii a aggravate felony be define as any of numerous offens list in a each of which be typically identify either as a offense describe in a specific federal statute or by a generic label murder section a penultimate sentence state that each enumerate crime be a aggravate felony irrespective of whether it violate federal state or foreign law petitioner jorge luna torres luna a lawful permanent resident plead guilty in a new york court to attempt arson when immigration official discover he conviction they initiate removal proceedings the immigration judge determine that luna arson conviction be for a aggravate felony and hold that luna be therefore ineligible for discretionary relief the board of immigration appeals affirm it find the federal and new york arson offens to be identical except for the former requirement that the crime have a connection to interstate or foreign commerce because the federal statute commerce element serve only a jurisdictional function the board hold new york arson offense be describe in the federal statute i for purpose of determine whether a alien have be convict of a aggravate felony the second circuit deny review hold a state offense count as a a aggravate felony when it have every element of a list federal crime except one require a connection to interstate or foreign commerce because congress lack general constitutional authority to punish crime most federal offens include a jurisdictional element to tie the substantive crime to one of congress enumerated power state legislature be not similarly constrain and so state crime do not need such a jurisdictional hook that discrepancy create the issue here whether a state offense lack a jurisdictional element but otherwise mirroring a particular federal offense can be say to be describe by that offense dictionary definition of the word describe do not clearly resolve this question one way or the other rather two contextual consideration decide this case a penultimate sentence and a background principle that distinguish between substantive and jurisdictional element in criminal statute a section a penultimate sentence show that congress mean the term aggravate felony to capture serious crime regardless of whether they be make illegal by the federal government a state or a foreign country but luna view would substantially undercut that function by exclude from the act coverage all state and foreign version of any enumerated federal offense contain a interstate commerce element and it would do so in a particularly perverse fashion exclude state and foreign conviction for many of a gravest crime most child pornography offens while reach conviction for far less harmful offens operate a unlawful gambling business luna theorize that such haphazard coverage might reflect congress belief that crime with a interstate connection be generally more serious than those without but it be implausible that congress view the presence of a interstate commerce element as separate serious from conduct luna theory misconceive the function of interstate commerce element and run counter to the penultimate sentence central message that the state federal or foreign nature of a crime be irrelevant and he claim that many serious crime exclude for want of a interstate commerce element would nonetheless count as a f crime s of violence provide little comfort that alternative would not include nearly all such offens nor even the worst one b the settle practice of distinguish between substantive and jurisdictional element in federal criminal statute also support reading a to include state analogue that lack only a interstate commerce requirement congress use substantive and jurisdictional element for different reason and do not expect they to receive identical treatment see united states yermian and that be true where as here the judicial task be to compare federal and state offens see lewis united states affirm kagan deliver the opinion of the court in which roberts and kennedy ginsburg and alito join sotomayor file a dissenting opinion in which thomas and breyer join opinion of the court notice this opinion be subject to formal revision before publication in the preliminary print of the united states reports reader be request to notify the reporter of decision supreme court of the united states washington of any typographical or other formal error in order that correction may be make before the preliminary print go to press jorge luna torres petitioner loretta lynch attorney general on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the second circuit may justice kagan deliver the opinion of the court the immigration and nationality act ina or act impose certain adverse immigration consequence on a alien convict of a aggravate felony the ina define that term by list various crime most of which be identify as offens describe in specify provision of the federal criminal code immediately follow that list the act provide that the reference offens be aggravate felony irrespective of whether they be in violation of federal state or foreign law stat a in this case we must decide if a state crime count as a aggravate felony when it correspond to a specify federal offense in all way but one namely the state crime lack the interstate commerce element use in the federal statute to establish legislative jurisdiction congress power to enact the law we hold that the absence of such a jurisdictional element be immaterial a state crime of that kind be a aggravate felony i the ina make any alien convict of a aggravate felony after enter the united states deportable see a a iii such a alien be also ineligible for several form of discretionary relief include cancellation of removal a order allow a deportable alien to remain in the country see a and because of he felony the alien face expedite removal proceedings see a a the act define the term aggravate felony by way of a long list of offens now codify at a in all that provision subparagraph enumerate some different crime in more than half of those subparagraph congress specify the crime by cite particular federal statute accord to that common formulation a offense be a aggravate felony if it be describe in say relate to child pornography g relate to unlawful gun possession or of particular relevance here i relate to arson and explosive a e i most of the remain subparagraph refer to crime by they generic label state that a offense be a aggravate felony if for example it be murder rape or sexual abuse of a minor a a follow the entire list of crime a penultimate sentence read the term aggravate felony apply to a offense describe in this paragraph whether in violation of federal or state law and apply to such a offense in violation of the law of a foreign country for which the term of imprisonment be complete within the previous year so put aside the curlicue the penultimate sentence provide that a offense list in a be a aggravate felony whether in violation of federal state or foreign law petitioner jorge luna torres who go by the name george luna immigrate to the united states as a child and have live here ever since as a lawful permanent resident in he plead guilty to attempt arson in the third degree in violation of new york law he be sentence to one day in prison and five year of probation seven year later immigration official discover he conviction and initiate proceedings to remove he from the country during those proceedings luna apply for cancellation of removal but the immigration judge find he ineligible for that discretionary relief because he arson conviction qualify as a aggravate felony see app to pet for cert the board of immigration appeals board affirm base on a comparison of the federal and new york arson statute see at the ina as just note provide that a offense describe in i the federal arson and explosive statute be a aggravate felony section i in turn make it a crime to maliciously damage or destroy or attempt to damage or destroy by means of fire or a explosive any building or vehicle use in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affect interstate or foreign commerce for its part the new york law that luna be convict under prohibit intentionally damag ing or attempt to damage a building or motor vehicle by start a fire or cause a explosion penal law ann west the state law the board explain thus match the federal statute with one exception the new york law do not require a connection to interstate commerce accord to the board that single difference do not matter because the federal statute commerce element be jurisdictional that be its function be to establish congress power to legislate see app to pet for cert give that the two law substantive element map onto each other the board hold the new york arson offense be describe in i the court of appeals for the second circuit deny luna petition for review of the board ruling see the court decision add to a circuit split over whether a state offense be a aggravate felony when it have all the element of a list federal crime except one require a connection to interstate commerce we grant certiorari ii the issue in this case arise because of the distinctive role interstate commerce element play in federal criminal law in we federal system congress can not punish felony generally cohens virginia wheat it may enact only those criminal law that be connect to one of its constitutionally enumerated power such as the authority to regulate interstate commerce as a result most federal offens include in addition to substantive element a jurisdictional one like the interstate commerce requirement of i the substantive element primarily define the behavior that the statute call a violation of federal law scheidler national organization for women or as the model penal code put the point they relate to the harm or evil the law seek to prevent the jurisdictional element by contrast tie the substantive offense here arson to one of congress constitutional power here its authority over interstate commerce thus spell out the warrant for congress to legislate see at explain that congress intend such statutory term as affect commerce or in commerce as term of art connect the congressional exercise of legislative authority with the constitutional provision here the commerce clause that grant congress that authority for obvious reason state criminal law do not include the jurisdictional element common in federal statute state legislature exercise they plenary police power be not limit to congress enumerated power and so states have no reason to tie they substantive offens to those grant of authority see united states lopez in particular state crime do not contain interstate commerce element because a state do not need such a jurisdictional hook accordingly even state offens whose substantive element match up exactly with a federal law will part way with respect to interstate commerce that slight discrepancy create the issue here if a state offense lack a interstate commerce element but otherwise mirror one of the federal statute list in a do the state crime count as a aggravate felony or alternatively do the jurisdictional difference reflect in the state and federal law preclude that result no matter the law substantive correspondence both party begin with the statutory text most directly at issue dispute when a state offense here arson be describe in a enumerate federal statute here i luna armed principally with black law dictionary argue that describe in means express or set forth in which he say require the state offense to include each one of the federal law element brief for petitioner the government brandish dictionary of its own contend that the statutory phrase have a looser meaning that describe entail not precise replication but convey ance of a idea or impression or of a thing central feature brief for respondent on that view describe in as oppose to the more precise define in sometimes find in statute denote that the state offense need only incorporate the federal law core substantive element but neither of those claim about the bare term describe in can resolve this case like many word describe take on different meaning in different context consider two way in which this court have use the word in one case describe convey exactness a contractual provision we write describe the subject matter with great particularity giv ing the precise number of pound of tobacco the tax for which each pound be liable and the aggregate of the tax ryan united states wall in another case not the disclosure provision be mean we state to describe the law to consumer in a manner that be concise and comprehensible to the layman which necessarily mean that it will be imprecise compucredit greenwood so stare at or even look up the word describe in can not answer whether a state offense must replicate every last element of a list federal statute include its jurisdictional one to qualify as a aggravate felony in consider that issue we must as usual interpret the relevant word not in a vacuum but with reference to the statutory context abramski united states slip at here two contextual consideration decide the matter the first be a penultimate sentence which show that congress mean the term aggravate felony to capture serious crime regardless of whether they be prohibit by federal state or foreign law the second be a background principle distinguish between substantive and jurisdictional element in federal criminal statute we address each factor in turn a section a penultimate sentence as note above provide the term aggravate felony apply to a offense describe in this paragraph whether in violation of federal or state law and apply to such a offense in violation of the law of a foreign country for which the term of imprisonment be complete within the previous year see supra at that sentence except for the time limit on foreign conviction declare the source of criminal law irrelevant the list offens count as aggravate felony regardless of whether they be make illegal by the federal government a state or a foreign country that be true of the crime identify by reference to federal statute as here a offense describe in i as well as those employ generic label for example murder as even luna recognize state and foreign analogue of the enumerate federal crime qualify as aggravate felony see brief for petitioner contest only what properly count as such a analogue the whole point of a penultimate sentence be to make clear that a list offense should lead to swift removal no matter whether it violate federal state or foreign law luna view of describe in would substantially undercut that function by exclude from the act coverage all state and foreign version of any enumerated federal offense that like i contain a interstate commerce element such a element appear in about half of a list statute define altogether serious crime yet under luna reading only those federal crime and not they state and foreign counterpart would provide a basis for a alien removal because as explain earlier only congress must ever show a link to interstate commerce see supra at no state or foreign legislature need to incorporate a commerce element to establish its jurisdiction and so none ever do accordingly state and foreign crime will never precisely replicate a federal statute contain a commerce element and that mean contrary to a penultimate sentence that the term aggravate felony would not apply to many of the act list offens irrespective of whether they be in violation of federal state or foreign law instead that term would apply exclusively to the federal variant indeed luna view would limit the penultimate sentence effect in a peculiarly perverse fashion exclude state and foreign conviction for many of the gravest crime list in a while reach those conviction for less harmful offens consider some of the state and foreign crime that would not count as aggravate felony on luna reading because the corresponding federal law have a commerce element most child pornography offens include sell a child for the purpose of manufacture such material see a i demand or receive a ransom for kidnapping see a h and possess a firearm after a felony conviction see a e ii conversely the term aggravate felony in luna world would include state and foreign conviction for such comparatively minor offens as operate a unlawful gambling business see a j and possess a firearm not identify by a serial number see a e iii because congress choose for whatever reason not to use a commerce element when bar that conduct and similarly the term would cover any state or foreign conviction for such nonviolent activity as receive steal property see a g or forge document see a r because the ina happen to use generic label to describe those crime this court have previously refuse to construe a so as to produce such haphazard indeed coverage nijhawan holder we see no reason to follow a different path here congress would not have place a alien convict by a state of run a illegal casino at greater risk of removal than one find guilty under the same state law of sell a child in a attempt to make some sense of he reading luna posit that congress might have believe that crime have a interstate connection be generally more serious than those lack one for example that interstate child pornography be worse than the intrastate variety brief for petitioner but to begin with that theory can not explain the set of result just describe not even luna maintain that congress think local act of sell a child receive explosive or demand a ransom be categorically less serious than say operate a unlawful casino or receive steal property whether or not in interstate commerce and it be scarcely more plausible to view a interstate commerce element in any give offense as separate serious from conduct why for example would congress see a alien who carry out a kidnapping for ransom wholly within a state as materially less dangerous than one who cross state line in commit that crime the essential harm of the crime be the same irrespective of state border luna argument thus misconceive the function of interstate commerce element rather than distinguish greater from lesser evil they serve as earlier explain to connect a give substantive offense to one of congress enumerated power see supra at and still more fundamentally luna account run counter to the penultimate sentence central message that the national local or foreign character of a crime have no bearing on whether it be grave enough to warrant a alien automatic removal luna and the dissent see post at must therefore fall back on a different defense that he approach would exclude from the universe of aggravate felony fewer serious state and foreign offens than one might think to make that argument luna rely primarily on a part of the act specify that the term aggravate felony shall include a crime of violence as define in for which the term of imprisonment be at least one year a f see define crime of violence as involve the use of physical force against the person or property of another accord to luna many state and foreign offens fail to match the act list federal statute for want of a interstate commerce element would count as crime of violence and by that alternative route trigger automatic removal a different statutory phrase or so luna say would thus plug the hole open by he construction of the describe in provision luna argument do not reassure we we agree that state counterpart of some enumerate federal offens would qualify as aggravate felony through the crime of violence provision but not nearly all such offens and not even the worst one consider again some of the list offens describe earlier see supra at the crime of violence provision would not pick up demand a ransom for kidnapping see a define the crime without any reference to physical force it would not cover most of the list child pornography offens involve the distribution receipt and possession of such material it would not reach law and other firearm offens and indeed it would not reach arson in the many states define that crime to include the destruction of one own property see jordison gonzales hold that a violation of california arson statute do not count as a crime of violence for that reason tr of oral arg solicitor general agree with that interpretation so under luna reading state and foreign counterpart to a broad swath of list statute would remain outside a coverage merely because they lack a explicit interstate commerce connection and for all the reason discuss above that result would significantly restrict the penultimate sentence force and effect and in a utterly random manner b just as important a settle practice of distinguish between substantive and jurisdictional element of federal criminal law support read a to include state analogue lack a interstate commerce requirement as already explain the substantive element of a federal statute describe the evil congress seek to prevent the jurisdictional element connect the law to one of congress enumerated power thus establish legislative authority see supra at ali model penal code both kind of element must be prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt and because that be so both may play a real role in a criminal case but still they be not create equal for every purpose to the contrary court have often recognize include when compare federal and state offens that congress use substantive and jurisdictional element for different reason and do not expect they to receive identical treatment consider the law respect men rea in general court interpret criminal statute to require that a defendant possess a men rea or guilty mind as to every element of a offense see elonis united states slip at that be so even when the statute by its term do not contain any demand of that kind united states video in such case court read the statute against a background rule that the defendant must know each fact make he conduct illegal staples united states or otherwise say they infer absent a express indication to the contrary that congress intend such a requirement except when it come to jurisdictional element there this court have state the existence of the fact that confer federal jurisdiction need not be one in the mind of the actor at the time he perpetrate the act make criminal by the federal statute united states feola see united states yermian jurisdictional language need not contain the same culpability requirement as other element of the offense model penal code so when congress have say nothing about the mental state pertain to a jurisdictional element the default rule flip court assume that congress want such a element to stand outside the otherwise applicable men rea requirement in line with that practice court have routinely hold that a criminal defendant need not know of a federal crime interstate commerce connection to be find guilty see united states jinian united states lindemann united states blackmon those court have recognize as we do here that congress view the commerce element as distinct from and subject to a different rule than the element describe the substantive offense still more strikingly court have distinguish between the two kind of element in context similar to this one in which the judicial task be to compare federal and state offens the assimilative crime act aca a subject federal enclave like military basis to state criminal law except when they punish the same conduct as a federal statute the aca thus require court to decide when a federal and a state law be sufficiently alike that only the federal one will apply and we have hold that in make that assessment court should ignore jurisdictional element when the difference among element of the state and federal crime reflect jurisdictional or other technical consideration alone then the state law will have no effect in the area lewis united states see also at kennedy dissent agree that court should look beyond jurisdictional element and focus only on substantive one in determine whether the element of the two crime be the same in such a case we reason just as we do now that congress mean for the federal jurisdictional element to be set aside and lower court have uniformly adopt the same approach when compare federal and state crime in order to apply the federal statute that law impose mandatory life imprisonment on a person convict on three separate occasion of a serious violent felony c sound very much like the ina the statute define such a felony to include a federal or state offense by whatever designation and wherever commit consist of specify crime murder manslaughter robbery as describe in list federal criminal statute c f in decide whether a state crime of conviction thus correspond to a enumerate federal statute every court to have face the issue have ignore the statute jurisdictional element see united states per curiam united states wicks judge wood write for the seventh circuit highlight the phrase a federal or state offense by whatever designation and wherever commit the law version of a penultimate sentence it be hard to see why congress would have use this language she reason if it have mean that every detail of the federal offense include its jurisdictional element have to be replicate in the state offense at just so too in the ina whose aggravate felony provision operate against and rely on a established legal backdrop distinguish between jurisdictional and substantive element luna object to draw that line on the ground that it be too hard to tell the difference between the two see brief for petitioner discuss in particular statute criminalize the destruction of federal property and send threat via the postal service but that contention collide with the judicial experience just describe court regularly separate substantive from jurisdictional element in apply federal criminal statute men rea requirement so too in implement other law that require a comparison of federal and state offens and from all we can see court perform that task with no real trouble luna have not pointed to any division between or within circuit arise from the practice we do not deny that some tough question may lurk on the margin where a element that make evident congress regulatory power also might play a role in define the behavior congress think harmful but a standard interstate commerce element of the kind appear in a great many federal law be almost always a simple jurisdictional hook and court may as easily acknowledge that fact in enforce the ina as they have do in other context c luna make a final argument oppose we reading of a if congress have mean for ordinary crime like arson to count as aggravate felony it would have draft the provision to make that brief for petitioner congress luna submit would have use the generic term for those crime arson rather than demand that the state law of conviction correspond to a list federal statute see at or else luna and the dissent suggest see at post at congress would have expressly distinguish between substantive and jurisdictional element as it do in a unrelated law mandate the pretrial detention of any person convict of a federal offense describe in a certain federal statute or of a state or local offense that would have be a offense describe in that statute if a circumstance give rise to federal jurisdiction have exist e a but as a initial matter congress may have have good reason to think that a statutory reference would capture more accurately than a generic label the range of state conviction warrant automatic deportation the clause of a apply to luna case well illustrate the point by refer to i that provision incorporate not only the arson offens that a generic arson label would cover but various explosive offens too see brief for petitioner concede that have congress use the term arson it would have have to separately identify the explosive crime encompass in i and the element of generic arson be themselves so uncertain as to pose problem for a court have to decide whether they be present in a give state law see poulos the metamorphosis of the law of arson describe multiple conflict over what conduct the term arson include nor be the clause at issue here unusual in those respects section a include many other statutory reference that do not convert easily to generic label see a e ii list federal statute define various firearm offens to be sure congress use such label to describe some crime qualify as aggravate felony for example murder rape or sexual abuse of a minor a a but what be good for some crime be not for other the use of a federal statutory reference show only that congress think it the best way to identify certain substantive crime not that congress want in conflict with the penultimate sentence to exclude state and foreign version of those offens for lack of a jurisdictional element still more congress omission of statutory language specifically direct court to ignore those element can not tip the scale in luna favor we have little doubt that congress could have draft a with more precision than it do graham county soil water conservation dist united states ex rel wilson but the same could be say of many even most statute as to that feature a can join a club and we have long be mindful of that fact when interpret law rather than expect let alone demand perfection in draft we have routinely construe statute to have a particular meaning even as we acknowledge that congress could have express itself more clearly see florida of revenue piccadilly cafeterias scarborough united states the question then be not could congress have indicate or even do congress elsewhere indicate in more crystalline fashion that comparison of federal and state offens should disregard element that merely establish legislative jurisdiction the question be instead and more simply be that the right and fair reading of the statute before we and the answer to that question give the import of a penultimate sentence and the background rule distinguish between jurisdictional and substantive element be yes iii that reading of a resolve this case luna have acknowledge that the new york arson law differ from the list federal statute i in only one respect it lack a interstate commerce element see pet for cert and luna nowhere contest that i commerce element feature the term in interstate or foreign commerce and affect interstate or foreign commerce be of the standard jurisdictional kind see tr of oral arg scheidler at refer to the phrase affect commerce and in commerce as conventional jurisdictional language for all the reason we have give such a element be properly ignore when determine if a state offense count as a aggravate felony under a we accordingly affirm the judgment of the second circuit it be so order sotomayor dissent jorge luna torres petitioner loretta lynch attorney general on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the second circuit may justice sotomayor with whom justice thomas and justice breyer join dissent the immigration and nationality act ina mete out severe immigration consequence to a noncitizen convict of any of a number of aggravate felon ie a a offense describe in i a federal arson statute qualify as such a crime in this case petitioner who go by george luna be convict of arson under penal law ann west which punish anyone who intentionally damages by start a fire or cause a explosion a building or motor vehicle by contrast the federal arson statute i apply when someone maliciously damages or destroy by means of fire or a explosive any building vehicle or other real or personal property use in interstate or foreign commerce there be one more element in the federal offense than in the state offense the interstate or foreign commerce element luna thus be not convict of a offense describe in the federal statute case close not for the majority it dub the fifth element jurisdictional then rely on contextual clue to read it out of the statute altogether as a result of the majority sleuthing luna a legal permanent resident be foreclose from even appeal to the sound discretion of the attorney general to obtain relief from removal because precedent and the text and structure of the ina require the opposite result i respectfully dissent i a noncitizen convict of crime face various consequence under the ina among the harshest of those consequence fall on noncitizen convict of of the approximately aggravate felony a crime that fall into one of the listed provision can be a aggravate felony whether in violation of federal or state law or in violation of the law of a foreign country see a a aggravate felony conviction have two primary repercussion for noncitizen it render they deportable a a iii and it make they categorically ineligible for several form of immigration relief ordinarily leave to the discretion of the attorney general see a b cancellation of removal the dozen of aggravate felony in the ina be specify in two main way first some be specify by reference to a generic crime it be a aggravate felony for instance to commit murder rape or sexual abuse of a minor a a some of those crime use a federal definition as one of the element for example illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as define in a b emphasis add illicit trafficking be a generic crime the element of controlled substance take the meaning in the definition provision of the controlled substances act second it list crime that be wholly describe in the federal criminal code see a h a offense describe in section or of title relate to the demand for or receipt of ransom a i a offense describe in section or of title relate to child pornography the government contend that luna commit a crime in this second category a offense describe in i which criminalize arson a e i b in luna be find removable from the united states he attempt to apply for cancellation of removal a form of relief available to legal permanent resident at the discretion of the attorney general a nothing in luna history would otherwise preclude cancellation he be the sole source of financial support for he citizen fiancée enrol in college and study engineering a homeowner and a legal permanent resident since he be bring to the united states as a child over year ago aside from the one arson conviction at issue in this case for which he serve a day in jail but the immigration judge find and the board of immigration appeals and the second circuit confirm that luna be ineligible for cancellation of removal luna new york state arson conviction the judge hold qualify as a aggravate felony under the provision for a offense describe in i a federal arson statute see a e i aggravate felon be ineligible for cancellation of removal see a luna application be thus summarily deny ii but the offense of which luna be convict be not describe in i this court ordinary method of interpret the aggravate felony statute the plain text of that provision and the structure of the ina all confirm as much a this be not the first time the court have be task with determine whether a state offense constitute a aggravate felony under the ina until today the court have always require the state offense to match every element of the list aggravate felony kawashima holder slip at see also moncrieffe holder slip at holder nijhawan holder gonzales lopez gonzales leocal ashcroft we ordinary methodology thus confirm that the federal arson statute do not describe the new york arson statute under which luna be convict as i have outline above see supra at the federal statute be more limited it apply only to fire that involve interstate or foreign commerce the state statute contain no such limitation thus under the approach we have use in every case to date the omission of the interstate commerce element mean that luna state arson conviction be not a aggravate felony under the ina b the plain language of the statute support this straightforward approach the word describe means to express portray or represent see black law dictionary ed webster third new international dictionary a description may be detail or it may be general set forth only the recognizable feature or characteristic mark of the thing describe while leave the rest to the imagination oxford english dictionary ed for example a craigslist ad describe a apartment with laundry a dishwasher rooftop access central and a closet may leave much to the imagination after all the description do not mention the apartment square footage window or floor number but though the ad omit feature we would still call it a description because it accurately convey the recognizable feature of the apartment however even the most general description can not refer to feature that the thing be describe do not have the ad be only a accurate description if the apartment describe in it have at least the five feature list if the apartment only have four of the five list feature there be no rooftop access say or the closet be not so much as then the craigslist ad no longer describe the apartment rather it misdescribe it so too with the statute in this case the federal description can be general as long as it be still accurate that be as long as the state law have at least all of the element in the federal law but there be no meaning of describe that allow the court to say i describe the new york offense when the new york offense only have four of the five element list in i section i misdescribe the new york offense just as surely as the craigslist ad misdescribe the apartment c the structure of the ina confirm that conclusion and make clear that we need not contort the ordinary accept meaning of the phrase describe in the ina have many overlap provision that assign carefully calibrate consequence to various type of criminal conviction the court thus need not interpret any provision and certainly none of the aggravate felony provision among the harshest in the ina as broadly as possible because the ina as a whole ensure that serious criminal conduct be adequately capture that overlap structure be apparent throughout the ina first the aggravate felony list itself have multiple provision most serious offens for instance will qualify as crime s of violence for which the term of imprisonment be at least one year a f even if they be not cover by a more specific provision in the aggravate felony list have he crime be charge as a more serious arson and have he be punish by one year of imprisonment instead of one day luna might have qualify as a aggravate felon under that provision see santana holder arson in new york be a crime of violence second other section of the ina provide intertwine coverage for serious crime some example of provision that encompass many offens include those for the commission of a crime involve moral turpitude a firearm offense or a controlled substance offense all of which will render a noncitizen removable even if he or she have not commit a aggravate felony see a a i b i c a a i ii judulang holder comment on the breadth of the crime involve moral turpitude provision and finally in luna case or anyone else the attorney general can exercise she discretion to deny relief to a serious criminal whether or not that criminal have be convict of a aggravate felony see at doubt that a narrow reading of a will have any practical effect on police we nation border to be sure on luna reading some serious conduct may not be capture by the ina but not nearly so much as the majority suggest by contrast once the aggravate felony statute apply to a noncitizen no provision in the ina and virtually no act by the attorney general can prevent he or she from be remove look for consistency in the aggravate felony provision of the ina be often a fool errand see kawashima at slip at ginsburg dissent note the absurdity of make a tax misdemeanor but not drive while drunk and cause serious bodily injury a aggravate felony but the structure of the ina give the court no reason to read the aggravate felony provision as broadly as possible that be why this court have repeatedly caution against interpret the aggravate felony section to sweep in offens that like many state arson conviction may be neither aggravate nor felony see at brief for national association of criminal defense lawyers et as amici curiae collect state misdemeanor arson statute iii the majority deny luna the opportunity to present he case to the attorney general base on two contextual consideration ante at and a intuition about how the statute ought to work none be sufficiently persuasive to overcome the most natural reading of the aggravate felony statute a the majority first perceive a conflict between luna reading of the ina and what it call the penultimate sentence of the aggravate felony statute the penultimate sentence provide that a offense can be a aggravate felony whether in violation of federal or state law or in violation of the law of a foreign country a the majority claim that luna reading of the ina would vitiate the quote proviso ante at it be true that on luna reading some of the aggravate felony list in the ina include a offense describe in i will have no state or foreign analog but the proviso still apply to generic offens which constitute nearly half of the entry in the aggravate felony list see a a g m i and that portion jump to close to of the offens after count those many list federal statute with no jurisdictional element see a c e ii j in fact it apply to the vast majority of offens adjudicate under the ina give that most serious crime be also crime of violence see a f and the majority must admit that its interpretation will also leave entry in the section with no state or foreign analog for instance it seem unlikely that the proviso contemplate state analog for the aggravate felony provision regard treason levy war against the united states or disclose national defense information see a l i p in other word under luna reading the penultimate sentence apply to most but not all of the entry of the aggravate felony statute under the majority reading the penultimate sentence also apply to most but not all of the entry of the aggravate felony statute the majority first contextual consideration thus supply no reason to prefer one read over the other b just as important the majority suggest be a settle practice of distinguish between substantive element those that define the evil congress seek to prevent and jurisdictional element s which merely establis h legislative authority ante at the majority admit that the court do not distinguish between substantive and jurisdictional element for many purpose such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt and the right to a jury trial see ring arizona but it nonetheless insist on a standard distinction so entrenched that congress must have intend it to apply even absent any particular indication in the ina none of the three example that the majority proffer be evidence of such a strong norm first the majority invoke we rule for interpret criminal statute ante at whereas we general assumption be that a defendant must know each fact make he conduct illegal court generally hold that a criminal defendant need not know the fact that satisfy the jurisdictional element of a statute but jurisdictional element be not the only element a defendant need not know under the default rule ante at for interpret public welfare offens court have hold that a defendant need not know that the substance he possess be a narcotic that the device he possess be unregistered or that he reenter the united states after previously be deport see staples united states cite united states balint and united states freed united states burwell cadc united states giambro united states but surely the majority would not suggest that if we agree with those holding regard men rea we must then ignore the controlled substance element of the drug trafficking aggravate felony the unregistered element of the unregistered firearm aggravate felony or the follow deportation element of the illegal reentry aggravate felony see a b e iii m i o so there be likewise no reason to believe that the default rule for assign men rea to jurisdictional element be embed in the ina the majority next point to two of the many statute that like the ina require compare the element of federal and state offens but in each case it be the statute language and context not some settle practice ante at that command the omission of the jurisdictional element the majority first example ante at be the assimilative crime act a a statute that incorporate state criminal law into federal enclave if the act or omission be not make punishable by any enactment of congress but would be punishable if commit or omit within the jurisdiction of the state the court hold that in identify such a gap court should ignore jurisdictional or other technical difference between a state and federal statute lewis united states but the way court match the element of a state law to a federal analog under the assimilative crimes act differ fundamentally from we ina inquiry the basic question under the assimilative crimes act be whether federal statute reveal a intent to occupy so much of the field as would exclude the use of the particular state statute at issue at under the assimilative crimes act the state statute be not compare to a single federal statute but rather to a complex of federal statute that roughly cover the same general conduct and policy ibid that statute thus have little to teach we about a in interpret the assimilative crimes act every member of the court reject the simple approach that the court generally employ to construe the aggravate felony provision of the ina see at kennedy dissent allow slight difference in definition between federal and state statute and use inquiry only as a start point the majority analogy to the federal three strike statute c f ante at be similarly unhelpful that provision count as a predicate serious violent felony any federal or state offense wherever commit consist of various crime include several as describe in federal statute ante at emphasis add though this court have not construe the statute the majority note that court of appeal disregard the jurisdictional element of federal statute in assess whether a state conviction be for a serious violent felony ante at but nearly all of the statute list in c f contain jurisdiction element the crime must take place within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states b or within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the united states and so on in the two case cite by the majority for instance ante at court of appeals conclude that a state robbery offense qualify as a offense describe in the federal bank robbery statute even though the robbery do not take place in a bank see united states wicks united states in that statute it be the wherever commit not some loose construction of describe in that specifically instruct the court that the location where a crime occur do not matter moreover in other statute where congress want to exclude jurisdictional element when compare state and federal offens it ordinarily just say so see e a require detention of defendant pend trial if the person have be convict of a state or local offense that would have be a offense describe in subsection f of this section if a circumstance give rise to federal jurisdiction have exist b b b b f d a d ii i ii b b xvi i ii absent comparably clear language the court should not presume that the ina intend deportability to depend on a settle practice ante at of occasionally distinguish between substantive and jurisdictional element c finally the majority suggest that it would be peculiarly perverse ante at to adopt luna reading of the statute because it would draw a distinction among crime base on a jurisdictional element that the majority assume be wholly divorce from the evil congress seek to prevent ante at the jurisdictional element of a federal statute the majority assert be as trivial as the perfunctory warning on a new electronic device a person would say that she have follow the instruction for set up a iphone that be describe in the user manual even if she in fact ignore the one instruct that she begin by read ing important safety information ante at see also ibid compare jurisdictional element to a detour in a itinerary for instance the majority assume that it would not be plausible ante at for congress to have think that interstate crime be worse than wholly intrastate crime perhaps but when face with a offense that like arson admit of a range of conduct from the minor to the serious congress could plausibly have conclude that arson prosecute as federal crime be more uniformly serious than arson prosecute as state crime and count only the former as aggravate felony see klein et why federal prosecutor charge a comparison of federal and new york state arson and robbery filings houston finding that arson prosecute federally involve more property damage and more injury than arson prosecute under state law that be because far from be token conventional jurisdictional element serve to narrow the kind of crime that can be prosecute not just to specify the sovereign that can do the prosecute take the federal statute at issue in this case section i require that the property destroy be use in interstate commerce the court have hold that standard jurisdictional element ante at demand the property active employment for commercial purpose and not merely a passive pass or past connection to commerce jones united states as a result the court hold that a defendant who throw a molotov cocktail through the window of a residential house could not be guilty under i because the house be not active ly use in interstate commerce at surely however a new york prosecutor could have secure a conviction under penal law ann have the same crime be prosecute in state rather than federal court the difference between a offense under penal law ann and a offense under i be thus more than a technical consideration about which authority choose to prosecute it be a difference that go to the magnitude and nature of the evil ante at itself on the majority reading legal permanent resident with conviction for minor state offens be foreclose from even appeal to the mercy of the attorney general against we standard method for compare statute and the text and structure of the ina the majority stack a suppose superfluity a practice and its conviction that jurisdictional element be mere technicality but a element be a element and i would not so lightly strip a federal statute of one i respectfully dissent footnote footnote compare holder find a aggravate felony in that circumstance spacek holder same nieto hernandez holder same mukasey same united states same with bautista attorney general decline to find a aggravate felony footnote that flat statement be infinitesimally shy of be wholly true we have find a handful of state criminal law with a interstate commerce element out of the ten or perhaps hundred of thousand of state crime on the book mississippi for example lift essentially verbatim the text of the federal money laundering statute when draft its own and thus wind up with such a element see code ann but because the incidence of such law be so vanishingly small and the few that exist play no role in luna argument we proceed without qualify each statement of the kind above footnote black law dictionary ed define describe as to express explain set forth relate recount narrate depict delineate portray luna also cite webster

word describe decide this case in luna favor because a description can not refer to feature that the thing be describe do not have post at opinion of sotomayor say the dissent if a craigslist ad describe a apartment as have a laundry a dishwasher rooftop access central and a closet it do not describe a apartment lack rooftop access ibid that be true enough but irrelevant the dissent be right that when someone describe a object by a list of specific characteristic he mean that the item have each of those attribute but thing be different when someone use a more general descriptor even when that descriptor as here a federal statute itself have a determinate set of element it would be natural for example to say in the exact syntax of a that a person follow the itinerary for a journey through brazil that be describe in a lonely planet guide if he travel every leg of the tour other than a brief detour north to petrópolis the lonely planet on the road destination brazil all internet

at after all it reason some list federal statute specifically those prohibit treason levy war against the united states and disclose national defense information will lack state or foreign analogue even under we construction see ibid but congress inclusion of a few federal offens that by they nature have no state or foreign analogue hardly excuse expel from the act coverage the countless state and foreign version of other serious crime footnote luna position in addition to produce this bizarre patchwork of coverage conflict with we ordinary assumption that congress when draft a statute give each provision independent meaning see united states butler these word can not be meaningless else they would not have be use until its most recent amendment a j provide that the term aggravate felony include any offense describe in relate to racketeer influence corrupt organization for which a sentence of year imprisonment or more may be impose a j supp i that provision now incorporate two more federal crime and use one year of prison as the threshold the federal racketeering statute cite have a interstate commerce element analogous state and foreign law per usual do not and therefore would fall outside a j on luna reading but if congress have mean to so exclude those state and foreign counterpart then a j final clause for which a sentence of year imprisonment may be impose would have be superfluous because federal racketeering be always punishable by more than five year imprisonment see a that language presence show that congress think a j would sweep in some state and foreign law the final clause serve to filter out such statute when but only when they apply to less serious conduct than the federal racketeering offense footnote the dissent attempt a variant of luna not so serious argument but to no better effect claim the dissent even if congress could not have v
