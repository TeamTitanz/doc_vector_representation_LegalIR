the clean air act direct the environmental protection agency to regulate emission of hazardous air pollutant from certain stationary source such as refinery and factory the agency may regulate power

plant emission pose risk to public health and the environment and because control capable of reduce these emission be available it find regulation necessary because the imposition of other clean air act requirement do not eliminate those risk the agency refuse to consider cost when make its decision it estimate however that the cost of its regulation to power plant would be billion a year but the quantifiable benefit from the result reduction in emission would be to million a year petitioner include states seek review of epa rule in the circuit which uphold the agency refusal to consider cost

cost similarly the modest principle of whitman american trucking when the clean air act expressly direct epa to regulate on the basis of a discrete factor that do not include cost the act should not be read as implicitly allow consideration of cost anyway have no bearing on this case furthermore the possibility of consider cost at a later stage when decide how much to regulate power plant do not establish its irrelevance at this stage and although the clean air act make cost irrelevant to the initial decision to regulate source other than power plant the whole point of have a separate provision for power plant be to treat power plant differently d epa must consider cost include cost of compliance before decide whether regulation be appropriate and necessary it will be up to the

the agency find regulation appropriate and necessary we must decide whether it be reasonable for epa to refuse to consider cost when make this finding i the clean air act establish a series of regulatory program to control air pollution from stationary source such as refinery and factory and move source such as car and airplane stat as amend one of these be the national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants program the program for short establish in its current form by the clean air act amendment of stat this program target for regulation emission of more than specify hazardous air pollutant b for stationary source in general the applicability of the program depend in part on how much pollution the source emit a source that emit more than ton of a single pollutant or more than ton of a combination of pollutant per year be call a major source a epa be require to regulate all major source under the program c a source whose emission do not cross the threshold be call a area source a the agency be require to regulate a area source under the program if it present a threat of adverse effect to human health or the environment warrant regulation c at the same time congress establish a unique procedure to determine the applicability of the program to power plant the act refer to these plant as electric utility steam generate unit but we will simply call they power plant quite apart from the program the clean air act amendment of subject power plant to various regulatory requirement the party agree that these requirement be expect to have the collateral effect of reduce power plant emission of hazardous air pollutant although the extent of the reduction be unclear congress direct the agency to perform a study of the hazard to public health reasonably anticipate to occur as a result of emission by power plant of hazardous air pollutant after imposition of the requirement of this chapter n a if the agency find regulation be appropriate and necessary after consider the result of the study it shall regulate power plant under ibid epa have interpret the act to mean that power plant become subject to regulation on the same term as ordinary major and area source see fed reg and we assume without decide that it be correct to do so and what be those term epa must first divide source cover by the program into category and subcategory in accordance with statutory criterion c for each category or subcategory the agency must promulgate certain minimum emission regulation know as floor standard d the statute generally calibrate the floor standard to reflect the emission limitation already achieve by the of source within the category or subcategory d in some circumstance the agency may also impose more stringent emission regulation know as standard the statute expressly require the agency to consider cost alongside other specified factor when impose standard d epa complete the study require by n a in fed reg and conclude that regulation of coal and power plant be appropriate and necessary in at in it reaffirm the finding divide power plant into subcategory and promulgate floor standard the agency find regulation appropriate because power plant emission of mercury and other hazardous air pollutant pose risk to human health and the environment and control be available to reduce these emission fed reg it find regulation necessary because the imposition of the act other requirement do not eliminate these risk ibid epa conclude that cost should not be consider when decide whether power plant should be regulate under at in accordance with executive order the agency issue a regulatory impact analysis alongside its regulation this analysis estimate that the regulation would force power plant to bear cost of billion per year at the agency could not fully quantify the benefit of reduce power plant emission of hazardous air pollutant to the extent it could it estimate that these benefit be worth to million per year ibid the cost to power plant be thus between and time as great as the quantifiable benefit from reduce emission of hazardous air pollutant the agency continue that its regulation would have ancillary benefit include cut power plant emission of particulate matter and sulfur dioxide substance that be not cover by the program although the agency finding do not rest on these ancillary effect at the regulatory impact analysis take they into account increase the agency estimate of the quantifiable benefit of its regulation to to billion per year at epa concede that the regulatory impact analysis play no role in its finding brief for federal respondents petitioner who include states seek review of epa rule in the court of appeals for the circuit as relevant here they challenge the agency

agency own estimate nearly billion a year epa refuse to consider whether the cost of its decision outweigh the benefit the agency give cost no thought at all because it consider cost irrelevant to its initial decision to regulate epa disregard of cost rest on its interpretation of n a which to repeat direct the agency to regulate power plant if it find such regulation be appropriate and necessary the agency accept that it could have interpret this provision to mean that cost be relevant to the decision to add power plant to the program tr of oral arg but it choose to read the statute to mean that cost make no difference to the initial decision to regulate see fed reg we further interpret the term appropriate to not allow for the consideration of cost fed reg cost do not have to be read into the definition of appropriate we review this interpretation under the standard set out in chevron natural resources defense council chevron direct court to accept a agency reasonable resolution of a ambiguity in a statute that the agency administer at even under this deferential standard however agency must operate within the bound of reasonable interpretation utility air regulatory group epa slip at internal quotation mark omit epa stray far beyond those bound when it read n to mean that it could ignore cost when decide whether to regulate power plant a the clean air act treat power plant differently from other source for purpose of the program elsewhere in congress establish cabined criterion for epa to apply when decide whether to include source in the program it require the agency to regulate source whose emission exceed specify numerical threshold major source it also require the agency to regulate source whose emission fall short of these threshold area source if they presen t a threat of adverse effect to human health or the environment warrant regulation c in stark contrast congress instruct epa to add power plant to the program if but only if the agency find regulation appropriate and necessary n a one do not need to open up a dictionary in order to realize the capaciousness of this phrase in particular appropriate be the classic broad and term that naturally and traditionally include consideration of all the relevant factor at opinion of kavanaugh although this term leave agency with flexibility a agency may not entirely fai l to consider a important aspect of the problem when decide whether regulation be appropriate state farm supra at read naturally in the present context the phrase appropriate and necessary require at least some attention to cost one would not say that it be even rational never mind appropriate to impose billion of dollar in economic cost in return for a few dollar in health or environmental benefit in addition cost include more than the expense of comply with regulation any disadvantage could be term a cost epa interpretation preclude the agency from consider any type of cost include for instance harm that regulation might do to human health or the environment the government concede that if the agency be to find that emission from power plant do damage to human health but that the technology need to eliminate these emission do even more damage to human health it would still deem regulation appropriate see tr of oral arg no regulation be appropriate if it do significantly more harm than good there be undoubtedly setting in which the phrase appropriate and necessary do not encompass cost but this be not one of they section n a direct epa to determine whether regulation be appropriate and necessary emphasis add agencies have long treated cost as a centrally relevant factor when decide whether to regulate consideration of cost reflect the understanding that reasonable regulation ordinarily require pay attention to the advantage and the disadvantage of agency decision it also reflect the reality that too much wasteful expenditure devote to one problem may well mean considerably fewer resource available to deal effectively with other perhaps more serious problem entergy riverkeeper breyer concur in part and dissent in part against the backdrop of this established administrative practice it be unreasonable to read a instruction to a administrative agency to determine whether regulation be appropriate and necessary as a invitation to ignore cost statutory context reinforce the relevance of cost the procedure govern power plant that we consider today appear in n which bear the caption electric utility steam generate unit in subparagraph a the part of the law that have occupy we attention so far congress require epa to study the hazard to public health pose by power plant and to determine whether regulation be appropriate and necessary but in subparagraph b and c congress call for two additional study one of they a study into mercury emission from power plant and other source must consider the health and environmental effect of such emission technology which be available to control such emission and the cost of such technology n b emphasis add this directive to epa to study cost be a further indication of the relevance of cost to the decision to regulate in a effort to minimize this express reference to cost epa now argue that n a require it to consider only the study mandate by that provision not the separate mercury study before decide whether to regulate power plant but when adopt the regulation before we the agency insist that the provision concern all three study provide a framework for epa determination of whether to regulate power plant fed reg it therefore decide to interpret the scope of the appropriate and necessary finding in the context of all three study fed reg emphasis add for example epa consider environmental effect relevant to the finding it deem the mercury study reference to this factor direct evidence that congress be concern with environmental effect fed reg epa consider availability of control relevant to the finding it think that do so be consistent with the mercury study reference to availability of control at epa conclude that regulation of power plant would be appropriate and necessary even if a single pollutant emit by they pose a hazard to health or the environment it believe that congress focus on a single pollutant in the mercury study support ed this interpretation ibid epa have not explain why n b reference to environmental effect and cost provide direct evidence that congress be concern with environmental effect but not direct evidence that it be concern with cost chevron allow agency to choose among compete reasonable interpretation of a statute it do not license interpretive gerrymander under which a agency keep part of statutory context it like while throw away part it do not b epa identify a handful of reason to interpret n a to mean that cost be irrelevant to the initial decision to regulate we find those reason unpersuasive epa point out that other part of the clean air act expressly mention cost while n a do not but this observation show only that n a broad reference to appropriateness encompass multiple relevant factor which include but be not limit to cost other provision specific reference to cost encompass just cost it be unreasonable to infer that by expressly make cost relevant to other decision the act implicitly make cost irrelevant to the appropriateness of regulate power plant by way of analogy the fourth amendment reasonableness clause require search to be r easonable while its warrant clause require warrant to be support by probable cause nobody would argue that by expressly make level of suspicion relevant to the validity of a warrant the fourth amendment implicitly make level of suspicion categorically irrelevant to the reasonableness of a search to the contrary all would agree that the expansive word reasonable encompass degree of suspicion alongside other relevant circumstance other part of the clean air act also expressly mention environmental effect while n a do not yet that do not stop epa from deem environmental effect relevant to the appropriateness of regulate power plant along similar line epa seek support in this court decision in whitman american trucking there the court address a provision of the clean air act require epa to set ambient air quality standard at level requisite to protect the public health with a adequate margin of safety b read naturally that discrete criterion do not encompass cost it encompass health and safety the court refuse to read that provision as carry with it a implicit authorization to consider cost in part because authority to consider cost have elsewhere and so often be expressly grant at american trucking thus establish the modest principle that where the clean air act expressly direct epa to regulate on the basis of a factor that on its face do not include cost the act normally should not be read as implicitly allow the agency to consider cost anyway that principle have no application here appropriate and necessary be a far more comprehensive criterion than requisite to protect the public health read fairly and in context as we have explain the term plainly subsume consideration of cost turn to the mechanic of the program epa argue that it need not consider cost when first decide whether to regulate power plant because it can consider cost later when decide how much to regulate they the question before we however be the meaning of the appropriate and necessary standard that govern the initial decision to regulate and as we have discuss context establish that this expansive standard encompass cost cost may become relevant again at a later stage of the regulatory process but that possibility do not establish its irrelevance at this stage in addition once the agency decide to regulate power plant it must promulgate certain minimum or floor standard no matter the cost here nearly billion a year the agency may consider cost only when impose regulation beyond these minimum standard by epa logic someone could decide whether it be appropriate to buy a ferrari without think about cost because he plan to think about cost later when decide whether to upgrade the sound system epa argue that the clean air act make cost irrelevant to the initial decision to regulate source other than power plant the agency claim that it be reasonable to interpret n a in a way that harmonize the program treatment of power plant with its treatment of other source this line of reasoning overlook the whole point of have a separate provision about power plant treat power plant differently from other stationary source congress craft narrow standard for epa to apply when decide whether to regulate other source in general these standard concern the volume of pollution emit by the source c and the threat pose by the source to human health or the environment c but congress write the provision before we more expansively direct the agency to regulate power plant if appropriate and necessary that congressional election settle this case the agency preference for symmetry can not trump a asymmetrical statute csx alabama of revenue epa persist that congress treated power plant differently from other source because of uncertainty about whether regulation of power plant would still be need after the application of the rest of the act requirement that be undoubtedly one of the reason congress treat power plant differently hence n a requirement to study hazard pose by power plant emission after imposition of the requirement of the rest of the act but if uncertainty about the need for regulation be the only reason to treat power plant differently congress would have require the agency to decide only whether regulation remain necessary not whether regulation be appropriate and necessary in any event epa state when it adopt the rule that congress do not limit the appropriate and necessary inquiry to the study mention in n a fed reg the agency instead decide that the finding should be understand in light of all three study require by n and as we have discuss one of those three study reflect concern about cost c the dissent do not embrace epa claim that congress make cost altogether irrelevant to the decision to regulate power plant instead it maintain that epa need not explicitly analyze cost before deem regulation appropriate because other feature of the regulatory program will on they own ensure the of regulation post at opinion of kagan this line of reasoning contradict the foundational principle of administrative law that a court may uphold agency action only on the grounds that the agency invoke when it take the action sec chenery when it deem regulation of power plant appropriate epa say that cost be irrelevant to that determination not that analysis would be defer until later much less do it say what the dissent now conclude that the consideration of cost at subsequent stage will ensure that the cost be not disproportionate to the benefit what it say be that cost be irrelevant to the decision to regulate that be enough to decide these case but for what it be worth the dissent vastly overstate the influence of cost at later stage of the regulatory process for example the dissent claim that the floor standard which the act calibrate to reflect emission limitation already achieve by the source in the industry reflect cost consideration because the power plant must have consider cost in arrive at they emission output post at epa do not rely on this argument and it be not obvious that it be correct because power plant be regulate under other federal and state law the power plant emission limitation might reflect regulation rather than decision similarly the dissent suggest that epa may consider cost when divide source into category and subcategory post at yet accord to epa it be not appropriate to premise subcategorization on cost fed reg emphasis add that statement presumably explain the dissent carefully word observation that epa consider technological geographic and other factor when draw category post at which factor be in turn related to cost in some way post at attenuate connection such as these hardly support the assertion that epa regulatory process feature exhaustive consideration of cost post at all in all the dissent have at most show that some element of the regulatory scheme mitigate cost in limited way it have not show that these element ensure if to take a hypothetical example regulate power plant would yield million in benefit the prospect of mitigating cost from billion to billion at later stage of the program would not by itself make regulation appropriate in all event we need not pursue these point because epa do not say that the part of the regulatory program mention by the dissent prevent the imposition of cost far in excess of benefit epa action must be measure by what it do not by what it might have do chenery supra at d we reasoning so far establish that it be unreasonable for epa to read n a to mean that cost be irrelevant to the initial decision to regulate power plant the agency must consider cost include most importantly cost of compliance before decide whether regulation be appropriate and necessary we need not and do not hold that the law unambiguously require the agency when make this preliminary estimate to conduct a formal analysis in which each advantage and disadvantage be assign a monetary value it will be up to the agency to decide as always within the limit of reasonable interpretation how to account for cost some of the respondent support epa ask we to uphold epa action because the accompany regulatory impact analysis show that once the rule ancillary benefit be consider benefit plainly outweigh cost the dissent similarly rely on these ancillary benefit when insist that the outcome here be a rule whose benefit exceed its cost post at as we have just explain however we may uphold agency action only upon the grounds on which the agency act even if the agency could have consider ancillary benefit when decide whether regulation be appropriate and necessary a point we need not address it plainly do not do so here in the agency own word the administrative record utterly refute the assertion that ancillary benefit form the basis for the appropriate and necessary finding fed reg the government concede moreover that epa do not rely on the regulatory impact analysis when decide to regulate power plant and that e ven if epa have consider cost it would not necessarily have adopt the approach set forth in that analysis brief for federal respondents we hold that epa interpret n a unreasonably when it deem cost irrelevant to the decision to regulate power plant we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals for the circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion it be so order thomas concur and et et al et al et al on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the district of columbia circuit june justice thomas concur the environmental protection agency epa ask the court to defer to its interpretation of the phrase appropriate and necessary in n a of the clean air act justice scalia opinion for the court demonstrate why epa interpretation deserve no deference under we precedent i write separately to note that its request for deference raise serious question about the constitutionality of we broader practice of defer to agency interpretation of federal statute see chevron natural resources defense council chevron deference be premise on a presumption that congress when it leave ambiguity in a statute mean for implementation by a agency understand that the ambiguity would be resolve first and foremost by the agency and desire the agency rather than the court to possess whatever degree of discretion the ambiguity allow smiley citibank south dakota we most often describe congress supposed choice to leave matter to agency discretion as a allocation of interpretive authority see national cable telecommunications brand x internet services refer to the agency as the authoritative interpreter within the limit of reason of ambiguous statute but we sometimes treat that discretion as though it be a form of legislative power see united states mead note that the agency speak s with the force of law when it address ambiguity in the statute or fill a space in the enact law even when congress do not actually have a intent as to a particular result either way chevron deference raise serious question as i have explain elsewhere t he judicial power as originally understand require a court to exercise its independent judgment in interpret and expound upon the law perez mortgage bankers opinion concurring in judgment slip at interpret federal statute include ambiguous one administer by a agency call for that exercise of independent judgment at slip at chevron deference preclude judge from exercise that judgment force they to abandon what they believe be the best reading of a ambiguous statute in favor of a agency construction brand x supra at it thus wrest from courts the ultimate interpretative authority to say what the law be marbury madison cranch and hand it over to the executive see brand x supra at note that the judicial construction of a ambiguous statute be not authoritative such a transfer be in tension with article iii vesting clause which vest the judicial power exclusively in article iii court not administrative agency art iii in reality as the court illustrate in the course of dismantle epa interpretation of n a agency interpret ambiguous statute typically be not engage in act of interpretation at all see ante at instead as chevron itself acknowledge they be engage in the formulation of policy at ambiguity thus become a implicit delegation of authority and that authority be use not to find the best meaning of the text but to formulate legally bind rule to fill in gap base on policy judgment make by the agency rather than congress although acknowledge this fact might allow we to escape the jaw of article iii vesting clause it run headlong into the tooth of article i be which vest a ll legislative powers herein grant in congress art for if we give the force of law to agency pronouncement on matter of private conduct as to which congress do not actually have a intent mead supra at we permit a body other than congress to perform a function that require a exercise of the legislative power see department of transportation association of american railroads thomas concur in judgment slip at these case bring into bold relief the scope of the potentially unconstitutional delegation we have come to countenance in the name of chevron deference what epa claim for itself here be not the power to make political judgment in implement congress policy nor even the power to make tradeoff between compete policy goal set by congress american railroads supra at opinion of thomas slip at collect case involve statute that delegate this legislative authority it be the power to decide without any particular fidelity to the text which policy goal epa wish to pursue should epa wield its vast power over electric utility to protect public health a pristine environment economic security we be tell that the breadth of the word appropriate authorize epa to decide for itself how to answer that question compare fed reg n othe about the definition of appropriate compel a consideration of cost emphasis add with tr of oral arg t he phrase appropriate and necessary do not by its term preclude the epa from consider cost emphasis add perhaps there be some unique historical justification for defer to federal agency see mead supra at scalia dissent but these case reveal how paltry a effort we have make to understand it or to confine ourselves to its boundary although we hold today that epa exceed even the extremely permissive limit on agency power set by we precedent we should be alarm that it feel sufficiently embolden by those precedent to make the bid for deference that it do here as in other area of we jurisprudence concern administrative agency see hardware hargis industries thomas dissent slip at we seem to be stray further and further from the constitution without so much as pause to ask why we should stop to consider that document before blithely give the force of law to any other agency interpretation of federal statute kagan dissent and et et al et al et al on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the district of columbia circuit june justice kagan with whom justice ginsburg justice breyer and justice sotomayor join dissent the environmental protection agency place emission limit on coal and oil power plant follow a lengthy regulatory process during which the agency carefully consider cost at the outset epa determine that regulate plant emission of hazardous air pollutant be appropriate and necessary give the harm they cause and explain that it would take cost into account in develop suitable emission standard next epa divide power plant into group base on technological and other characteristic bear significantly on they cost structure it require plant in each group to match the emission level already achieve by the member of the same group benchmark necessarily reflect those plant own cost analysis epa then adopt a host of measure design to make compliance with its propose emission limit less costly for plant that need to catch up with they cleaner peer and with only one narrow exception epa decide not to impose any more stringent standard beyond what some plant have already achieve on they own because it find that do so would not be after all that epa conduct a formal study which find that the quantifiable benefit of its regulation would exceed the cost up to nine time over by as much as billion each year those benefit include as many as fewer premature death annually along with a far greater number of avoid illness despite that exhaustive consideration of cost the court strike down epa rule on the ground that the agency unreasonably deem cost irrelevant ante at on the majority theory the rule be invalid because epa do not explicitly analyze cost at the very first stage of the regulatory process when make its appropriate and necessary finding and that be so even though epa later take cost into account again and again and so on the majority think entirely immaterial and so entirely ignore all the subsequent time and way epa consider cost in decide what any regulation would look like that be a peculiarly blinkered way for a court to assess the lawfulness of a agency rulemaking i agree with the majority let there be no doubt about this that epa power plant regulation would be unreasonable if t he agency give cost no thought at all ante at emphasis in original but that be just not what happen here over more than a decade epa take cost into account at multiple stage and through multiple means as it set emission limit for power plant and when make its initial appropriate and necessary finding epa know it would do exactly that know it would thoroughly consider the of emission standard later on that context matter the agency act well within its authority in decline to consider cost at the opening bell of the regulatory process give that it would do so in every round thereafter and give that the emission limit finally issue would depend crucially on those accounting indeed epa could not have measure cost at the process initial stage with any accuracy and the regulatory path epa choose parallel the one it have tread in set emission limit at congress explicit direction for every other source of hazardous air pollutant over two decade the majority decision that epa can not take the same approach here its micromanagement of epa rulemaking base on little more than the word appropriate run counter to congress allocation of authority between the agency and the court because epa reasonably find that it be appropriate to decline to analyze cost at a single stage of a regulatory proceeding otherwise imbue with cost concern i respectfully dissent i a the clean air act amendment of as the majority describe obligate epa to regulate emission of mercury and other hazardous air pollutant from stationary source discharge those substance in large quantity see ante at for most industry the statute prescribe the same regulatory process at the initial stage epa must decide whether to regulate a source base solely on the quantity of pollutant it emit and they health and environmental effect see a a c c ante at cost enter the equation after that affect the emission limit that the eventual regulation will require under the statute epa must divide source into category and subcategory and then set floor standard that reflect the average emission level already achieve by the of source within each group see d ante at every floor have cost concern build right into it because the top source as successful actor in a market economy have have to consider cost in choose they own emission level moreover in establish category and subcategory at this first stage epa can significantly raise or lower the cost of regulation for each source because different classification scheme will alter the group and so the emission level that the source have to match once the floor be set epa have to decide whether to impose any stricter standard take into consideration among other thing the cost of achieve such emission reduction d see ante at finally by virtue of a longstanding executive order apply to significant rule issue under the clean air act as well as other statute the agency must systematically assess the regulation cost and benefit see exec order fed reg apply to all rule with a annual economic effect of at least million congress modify that regulatory scheme for power plant it do so because the amendment establish a separate program to control power plant emission contribute to acid rain and many think that just by comply with those requirement plant might reduce they emission of hazardous air pollutant to acceptable level see ante at that prospect counsel a wait and see approach under which epa would give the act acid rain provision a chance to achieve that side benefit before impose any further regulation accordingly congress instruct epa to perform a study of the hazard to public health reasonably anticipate to result from power plant emission after the amendment have take effect n a and congress provide that epa shall regulate those emission only if the agency find such regulation be appropriate and necessary after consider the result of the public health study ibid upon make such a finding however epa be to regulate power plant as it do every other stationary source first by categorize plant and set floor standard for the different group then by decide whether to regulate beyond the floor and finally by conduct the analysis require by executive order epa complete the mandate health study in and the result give much cause for concern the agency conclude that implementation of the acid rain provision have fail to curb power plant emission of hazardous air pollutant indeed epa find coal plant be on track to increase those emission by as much as over the next decade see epa study of hazardous air pollutant emissions from electric utility steam generating unit final report to congress and epa determine focus especially on mercury that the substance release from power plant cause substantial health harm note that those plant be the largest source of mercury emission at epa find that child of mother expose to high dose of mercury during pregnancy have exhibit a variety of developmental neurological abnormality include delay walk and talk altered muscle and cerebral palsy at to see also epa mercury study report to congress mercury study estimate that of woman of childbearing age be expose to mercury in amount exceed a safe level inform by its public health study and additional datum epa find in that it be appropriate and necessary to regulate power plant emission of mercury and other hazardous air pollutant fed reg pull apart those two adjective the agency first state that such regulation be appropriate because those pollutant present significant hazard to public health and the environment and because a number of control option can effectively reduce they emission ibid epa then determine that regulation be necessary because other part of the amendment most notably the acid rain provision will not adequately address those hazard ibid in less bureaucratic term epa decide that it make sense to kick off the regulatory process give that power plant emission pose a serious health problem that solution to the problem be available and that the problem will remain unless action be take b if the regulatory process end as well as start there i would agree with the majority conclusion that epa fail to adequately consider cost cost be almost always a relevant and usually a highly important factor in regulation unless congress provide otherwise a agency act unreasonably in establish a process that ignore s economic consideration industrial union american petroleum institute powell concur in part and concur in judgment at a minimum that be because such a process would threaten to impose massive cost far in excess of any benefit entergy riverkeeper breyer concur in part and dissent in part and accounting for cost be particularly important in a age of limited resource available to deal with grave environmental problem where too much wasteful expenditure devote to one problem may well mean considerably fewer resource available to deal effectively with other perhaps more serious problem at see ante at as the court note that do not require a agency to conduct a formal analysis of every administrative action see ante at but absent contrary indication from congress a agency must take cost into account in some manner before impose significant regulatory burden that proposition however do not decide the issue before we because the appropriate and necessary finding be only the beginning at that stage epa know that a lengthy rulemaking process lay ahead of it the determination of emission limit be still year away and the agency in make its finding explicitly note that consideration of cost would follow as a part of develop a regulation that would impose those limit the effectiveness and cost of control will be examine fed reg likewise epa explain that in the course of write its regulation it would explore regulatory approach allow for solution at that mean the agency when make its appropriate and necessary finding do not decline to consider cost as part of the regulatory process rather it decline to consider cost at a single stage of that process know that they would come in later on the only issue in these case then be whether epa act reasonably in structure its regulatory process in that way in make its appropriate and necessary finding base on pollution harmful effect and channel cost consideration to phase of the rulemaking in which emission level be actually set said otherwise the question be not whether epa can reasonably find it appropriate to regulate without think about cost full stop it can not and it do not rather the question be whether epa can reasonably find it appropriate to trigger the regulatory process base on harm and technological feasibility alone give that cost will come into play in multiple way and at multiple stage before any emission limit go into effect in consider that question the very nature of the word appropriate matter t he word appropriate this court have recognize be inherently give it content require pay attention to the surround circumstance sossamon texas slip at that be true too of the word necessary although the majority spend less time on it see armour wantock t he word necessary have always be recognize as a word to be harmonize with its context and here that mean consider the place of the appropriate and necessary find in the broader regulatory scheme as a trigger mechanism that get a complex rulemaking go the interpretive task be thus at odds with the majority insistence on stare fixedly at this stage ante at emphasis in original the task instead demand take account of the entire regulatory process in think about what be appropriate in its first phase the statutory language in other word be a directive to remove one blinders and view thing whole to consider what it be fitting to do at the threshold stage give what will happen at every other and that instruction be primarily give to epa not to court judge may interfere only if the agency way of order its regulatory process be unreasonable something congress would never have allow the question here as in we seminal case direct court to defer to agency interpretation of they own statute arise not in a sterile textual vacuum but in the context of implement policy decision in a technical and complex arena chevron natural resources defense council epa experience and expertise in that arena and court lack of those attribute demand that judicial review proceed with caution and care the majority actually phrase this principle well though honor it only in the breach within wide bound it be up to the agency to decide how to account for cost ante at that judge might have make different regulatory choice might have consider cost in different way at different time will not suffice to overturn epa action where congress as here choose not to speak directly to those matter but to leave they to the agency to decide all of that mean we decision here properly rest on something the majority think irrelevant a understanding of the full regulatory process relate to power plant and of epa reason for consider cost only after make its initial appropriate and necessary finding i therefore turn to those issue to demonstrate the simple point that should resolve these case that epa in regulate power plant emission of hazardous air pollutant account for cost in a reasonable way ii a in the year after its appropriate and necessary finding epa make good on its promise to account for cost a be a part of develop a regulation fed reg see supra at for more than a decade as epa deliberate on and then set emission limit cost come into the calculus at nearly every turn reflect that consideration epa final rule note that step take during the regulatory process have focus on flexib ility and ness and have succeed in make the rule less costly and compliance more readily manageable fed reg and the regulation conclude that the benefit of th e rule to public health and the environment far outweigh the cost at consistent with the statutory framework epa initially calculate floor standard emission level of the of power plant in a give category or subcategory the majority misperceive this part of the rulemaking process it insist that epa must promulgate certain floor standard no matter the cost ante at but that ignore two crucial feature of the limit first the way in which any such standard intrinsically account for cost and second the way in which the agency categorization decision yield different standard for plant with different cost structure the initial point be a fact of life in a market economy cost necessarily play a role in any standard that use power plant exist emission level as a benchmark after all the of power plant must have consider cost in arrive at they emission output that be how enterprise make decision and in do so they must have select achievable level else they would have go out of business the same would be true even if other regulation influence some of those choice as the majority casually speculate see ante at indeed this automatic accounting for cost be why congress adopt a standard as the senate report accompany the amendment explain cost consideration be reflect in the selection of emission limitation which have be achieve in practice rather than those which be merely theoretical by source of a similar type or character of course such a standard remain it require laggard in the industry to catch up with frontrunner sometimes at significant expense but the benchmark be by definition one that some power plant have achieve economically and when epa make its appropriate and necessary finding it know that fact know that the consequence of do so be to generate floor standard with cost consideration baked right in still more epa recognize that in make categorization decision it could take account of multiple factor relate to cost of compliance and so avoid impracticable regulatory burden suppose to use a simple example that curb emission be more technologically difficult and therefore more costly for plant burn coal than for plant burn oil epa can then place those two type of plant in different category so that coal plant need only match other coal plant rather than have to incur the add cost of meet the top oil plant level now multiply and complexify that example many time over as the agency note when make its appropriate and necessary finding epa build s flexibility into the regulatory regime by bas ing subcategorization on the size of a facility the type of fuel use at the facility and the plant type and also may consider other relevant factor such as geographic condition fed reg see at listing similar factor and note that t he proper definition of category will assure maximum protection of public health and the environment while minimize cost impose on the regulate community use that classification tool epa can ensure that plant have to attain only the emission level previously achieve by peer face comparable cost constraint so as to further protect plant from unrealistic floor standard and that be exactly what epa do over the course of its rulemaking process insist on comparison that bring floor standard within reach of diverse kind of power plant even in make its appropriate and necessary finding the agency announce it would divide plant into the two category mention above and fed reg then as the rulemake progress epa go further note that different technology significantly affect the ease of attain a give emission level the agency propose rule subdivide those two class into five plant design to burn coal plant design to burn virgin coal plant that run on a technology term integrated gasification combined cycle liquid oil unit and solid oil unit see fed reg epa explain that by subcategorize in that way it have spare many plant the need to retrofit redesign or make other extensive change to they facility at and in its final rule epa further refine its grouping in way that ease compliance most notably the agency establish a separate subcategory and attendant less stringent floor for plant in hawaii puerto rico guam and the virgin islands on the ground that plant in those place have minimal control over the quality of available fuel and disproportionately high operational and maintenance cost fed reg even after establish multiple floor standard that factored in cost epa adopt additional compliance option to minimize cost associate with attain a give floor just as its appropriate and necessary find explicitly contemplate at fed reg see fed reg for example the agency calculate each floor as both a standard base on emission per unit of energy use and a standard base on emission per unit of useful energy produce and allow plant to choose which standard they would meet that option epa explain can result in reduce compliance cost fed reg similarly epa allow plant to meet a give floor by average emission across all unit at the same site instead of have to meet the floor at each unit some plant epa understand would find such average a less costly alternative fed reg yet again epa permit limited use plant those primarily burn natural gas but sometimes switch to oil to comply with the final rule by meeting qualitative work practice standard rather than numeric emission limit at epa explain that it would be economically impracticable for those plant to demonstrate compliance through emission testing and that a alternative standard focus on they adoption of pollution control technique would allow they to both reduce emission and avoid extra cost at and the list go on see at allow extra year for plant to comply with emission limit where construction permit or labor procurement or resource challenge arise at describe additional compliance option with all that under its belt epa next assess whether to set standard and here too as it know it would the agency take cost into account for the vast majority of coal and oil plant epa decide that standard would not be reasonable after consider cost at the agency set such a standard for only a single kind of plant and only after determine that the technology need to meet the more lenient limit would also achieve the more stringent one see at fed reg otherwise epa determine the standard be enough finally as require by executive order and as anticipate at the time of the appropriate and necessary finding epa conduct a formal analysis of its new emission standard and incorporate those finding into its propose and final rule see at fed reg that analysis estimate that the regulation yearly cost would come in at under billion while its annual measureable benefit would total many time more between and billion see at ante at on the cost side epa acknowledge that plant compliance with the rule would likely cause electricity price to rise by about but project that those price would remain lower than they have be as recently as see fed reg epa also think the rule impact on job would be about a wash with job lose at some plant but gain both at cleaner plant and in the pollution control industry see ibid on the benefit side epa note that it could not quantify many of the health gain that would result from reduce mercury exposure see at but even put those aside the rule annual benefit would include between and fewer premature death from respiratory and cardiovascular cause fewer emergency room visit for asthmatic child fewer heart attack and fewer day of lose work see at those concrete finding matter to these case which after all turn on whether epa reasonably take cost into account in regulate plant emission of hazardous air pollutant the majority insist that it may ignore epa analysis because epa do not rely on it when issue the initial appropriate and necessary finding ante at quote solicitor general see also sec chenery at one level that description be true indeed a simple function of chronology the finding precede the analysis by year and so could not have take its conclusion into account but more fundamentally the majority account be off because epa know when it make that find that it would consider cost at every subsequent stage culminate in a formal study and epa know that absent unusual circumstance the rule would need to pass that review in order to issue see exec order fed reg each agency shall adopt a regulation only upon a reason determination that the benefit of the intended regulation justify its cost the reasonableness of the agency decision to consider only the harm of emission at the threshold stage must be evaluate in that broader context and in think about that issue it be well to remember the outcome here a rule whose benefit exceed its cost by three to nine time in make its appropriate and necessary finding epa have commit to assess and mitigate cost throughout the rest of its rulemaking if nothing else the finding of the agency analysis make clear that the final emission standard be show that epa do just that b suppose you be in charge of design a regulatory process the subject matter a industry emission of hazardous material be highly complex involve multivarious factor demand year of study would you necessarily try to do everything at once or might you try to break down this lengthy and complicated process into discrete stage and might you consider different factor in different way at each of those juncture i think you might you know that everything must get do in the end every relevant factor consider but you tend to think that in the end do not mean in the beginning and you structure you rulemaking process accordingly start with a threshold determination that do not mirror you analysis would that be at least which be all it must be a reasonable policy choice chevron at that be the question present here and it nearly answer itself set emission level for hazardous air pollutant be necessarily a lengthy and complicated process demand analysis of many consideration over many year cost be a key factor in that process as i have say sensible regulation require careful scrutiny of the burden that potential rule impose see supra at but in order its regulatory process epa know it would have the opportunity to consider cost in one after another of that rulemaking stage in set the level of floor standard in provide a range of option for plant to meet they in decide whether or where to require limit beyond the floor and in finally complete a formal analysis see fed reg supra at give that context epa reasonably decide that it be appropriate once again the only statutory requirement relevant here to trigger the regulatory process base on the twin finding that the emission in question cause profound health and environmental harm and that available pollution control technology can reduce those emission by make that decision epa do no more than commit itself to develop a realistic and regulation a rule that would take account of every relevant factor cost and benefit alike and indeed particular feature of the statutory scheme here indicate that epa policy choice be not just a minimally reasonable option but a eminently reasonable one to start that decision bring epa regulation of power plant into sync with its regulation of every other significant source of hazardous pollutant under the clean air act for all those type of source total over the act instruct epa to make the threshold decision to regulate base solely on the quantity and effect of pollutant discharge cost enter the picture afterward when the agency take up the task of actually establish emission limit see supra at industry after industry year after year epa have follow that approach to just as congress contemplate see fed reg dry cleaning facility fed reg gasoline distributor fed reg aerospace manufacturer and apparently with considerable success at any rate neither those challenge this rule nor the court remotely suggest that these regulatory regime have do significantly more harm than good ante at so when make its appropriate and necessary find for power plant epa have good reason to continue in the same vein see entergy at opinion of breyer note that the reasonableness of a agency approach to consider cost rest in part on whether that tack have meet with apparent success in the past and that be exactly how epa explain its choice state that it would consider the cost of control when develop a regulation the agency note that such a approach have help build flexibility in meeting environmental objective in the past thereby prevent the imposition of disproportionate cost fed reg indeed as epa further comment in issue its rule it would seem inequitable to impose a regulatory regime on every industry in america and then to exempt one category after find it represent a significant part of the air toxic problem fed reg quote cong rec statement of durenberger the majority attempt to answer this point founder on even its own statement of fact the majority object that the whole point of have a separate provision about power plant be to treat power plant differently from other stationary source ante at emphasis in original but turn back about page and read what the majority say about why congress treat power plant differently because as all party agree separate regulatory requirement involve acid rain be expect to have the collateral effect of reduce power plant emission of hazardous air pollutant although the extent of the reduction be unclear ante at see supra at for that reason alone the majority do not offer any other congress divert epa from its usual regulatory path instruct the agency as a preliminary matter to complete and consider a study about the residual harm to public health arise from those emission see ante at supra at but once epa find in its study that the acid rain provision would not significantly affect power plant emission of hazardous pollutant any rationale for treat power plant differently from other source discharge the same substance go up in smoke see fed reg at that point the agency would have have far more explain to do if rather than follow a model it have devise a new scheme of regulation for power plant only still more epa could not have accurately assess cost at the time of its appropriate and necessary finding see mercury study at note the many uncertainty in any analysis of pollution control cost under the statutory scheme that finding come before year before the agency design emission standard and until epa know what standard it will establish it can not know what cost they will impose nor can those standard even be reasonably guesstimate at such a early stage consider what it take to set floor standard alone first epa must divide power plant into category and subcategory as explain earlier those classification decision significantly affect what floor be establish see supra at and and then epa must figure out the average emission level already achieve by the top in each class so as to set the new standard none of that can realistically be accomplish in advance of the agency regulatory process indeed those step be the very stuff of the rulemaking similarly until epa know what compliance option it will develop it can not know how they will mitigate the cost plant must incur to meet the floor standard see supra at and again decide on those option take substantial time so there be good reason for different consideration to go into the threshold finding than into the final rule simply put calculate cost before start to write a regulation would put the cart before the horse iii the central flaw of the majority opinion be that it ignore everything but one thing epa do it forget that epa appropriate and necessary finding be only a first step which get the rest of the regulatory process rolling it narrow its field of vision to that finding in isolation with barely a glance at all the way in which epa later take cost into account see supra at in establish floor standard supra at in adopt compliance option supra at in decide whether to regulate beyond the floor supra at in conduct a formal analysis as a final check in sum the majority disregard how consideration of cost infuse the regulatory process result not only in epa adoption of mitigation measure ante at but also in epa craft of emission standard that succeed in produce benefit many time they price that mistake account for the majority primary argument that the word appropriate as use in n a demand consideration of cost see ante at as i have note that would be true if the appropriate and necessary finding be the only step before impose regulation on power plant see supra at but as should be more than clear by now it be just the first of many under the clean air act a long road lay ahead in which the agency would have more and far better opportunity to evaluate the cost of diverse emission standard on power plant just as it do on all other source see supra at epa well understand that fact we evaluate the term appropriate and necessary it explain in light of they statutory context fed reg and epa structure its regulatory process accordingly with consideration of cost come multiple time after the threshold finding the only way the majority can cast that choice as unreasonable give the deference this court owe to such agency decision be to blind itself to the broader rulemaking scheme the same fault inhere in the majority secondary argument that epa engage in a interpretive gerrymander by consider environmental effect but not cost in make its appropriate and necessary finding ante at the majority note quite rightly that congress call for epa to examine both subject in a study of mercury emission from all source separate from the study relate to power plant emission alone see ante at and the majority state again rightly that congress demand for that study provide direct evidence that congress be concern with both environmental effect and cost ante at internal quotation mark omit but nothing follow from that fact because epa too be concern with both true enough epa assess the two at different time environmental harm along with health harm at the threshold cost afterward but that be for the very reason earlier describe because epa want to treat power plant like other source and because it think harm but not cost could be accurately measure at that early stage see supra at congress simple request for a study of mercury emission in no way conflict with that choice of when and how to consider both harm and cost once more the majority perceive a conflict only because it take so partial a view of the regulatory process and the identical blind spot cause the majority metaphor to run off the road the majority liken epa to a hypothetical driver who decide that it be appropriate to buy a ferrari without think about cost because he plan to think about cost later when decide whether to upgrade the sound system ante at the comparison be witty but wholly inapt to begin with emission limit be not a luxury good they be a safety measure design to curtail the significant health and environmental harm cause by power
