to meet the purpose of the law to be arrive at by a consideration of the language in which those purpose be express and of the circumstance under which the language be employ in short although dictionary definition of the word tangible and object bear consideration they be not dispositive of the meaning of tangible object in support a reading of tangible object as use in in accord with dictionary definition the government point to the appearance of that term in federal rule of criminal procedure that rule require the prosecution to grant a defendant request to inspect tangible

section position within chapter of title further signal that be not intend to serve as a ban on the destruction of physical evidence of every kind congress place and its companion provision at the end

passage of c which be contain in a section of the act discrete from the section embrace and be also instructive section c provide c whoever corruptly alter destroy mutilate or conceal a record document or other object or attempt to do so with the intent to impair the object integrity or availability for use in a official proceeding shall be fine under this title or imprison not more than

no doubt would violate as well for apply to the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter not just to a official proceeding the government acknowledge that under its reading and c significantly overlap brief for united states nowhere do the government explain what independent function c would serve if the government be right about the sweeping scope of we resist a reading of that would render superfluous a entire provision pass in proximity as part of the same act see marx general revenue slip at t he canon against surplusage be strongest when a interpretation would render superfluous another part of the same statutory scheme the word immediately surround tangible object in falsify or make a false entry in any record or document also cabin the contextual meaning of that term as explain in gustafson alloyd we rely on the principle of noscitur a sociis a word be know by the company it keep to avoid ascribe to one word a meaning so broad that it be inconsistent with its accompany word thus give unintended breadth to the act of congress internal quotation mark omit see also united states williams a word be give more precise content by the neighbor word with which it be associate in gustafson we interpret the word communication in of the securities act of to refer to a public communication rather than any communication because the word appear in a list with other word notably notice circular and advertisement make it apparent that the list refer red to document of wide dissemination at and we do so even though the list begin with the word any the noscitur a sociis canon operate in a similar manner here tangible object be the last in a list of term that begin any record or document the term be therefore appropriately read to refer not to any tangible object but specifically to the subset of tangible object involve record and document object use to record or preserve information see united states sentence commission guideline manual records document or tangible object include a record document or tangible object that be store on or that be magnetic optical digital other electronic or other storage medium or device and b wire or electronic communication this moderate interpretation of tangible object accord with the list of action proscribe the section apply to anyone who alter destroy mutilate conceal cover up falsify or make a false entry in any record document or tangible object with the requisite obstructive intent emphasis add the last two verb falsif y and mak e a false entry in typically take as grammatical object record document or thing use to record or preserve information such as logbook or hard drive see black law dictionary ed define falsify as t o make deceptive to counterfeit forge or misrepresent to tamper with a document record it would be unnatural for example to describe a killer act of wipe he fingerprint from a gun as falsify the murder weapon but it would not be strange to refer to falsify datum store on a hard drive as simply falsify a hard drive furthermore congress do not include on c list of prohibit action falsify or make a false entry in see c make it unlawful to alte r destro y mutilat e or concea l a record document or other object with the requisite obstructive intent that contemporaneous omission also suggest that congress intend tangible object in to have a narrower scope than other object in c a canon related to noscitur a sociis ejusdem generi counsel where general word follow specific word in a statutory enumeration the general word be usually construe to embrace only object similar in nature to those object enumerate by the precede specific word washington state of social and health servs guardianship estate of keffeler internal quotation mark omit in begay united states for example we rely on this principle to determine what crime be cover by the statutory phrase any crime that be burglary arson or extortion involve use of explosive or otherwise involve conduct that present a serious potential risk of physical injury to another e b ii the enumeration of specific crime we explain indicate that the otherwise involve provision cover only similar crime rather than every crime that present a serious potential risk of physical injury to another at have congress intend the latter all encompass meaning we observe it be hard to see why it would have need to include the example at all ibid see also csx alabama of revenue slip at we typically use ejusdem generi to ensure that a general word will not render specific word meaningless just so here have congress intend tangible object in to be interpret so generically as to capture physical object as dissimilar as document and fish congress would have have no reason to refer specifically to record or document the government unbounded reading of tangible object would render those word mislead surplusage have use traditional tool of statutory interpretation to examine marker of congressional intent within the act and itself we be persuade that a aggressive interpretation of tangible object must be reject it be highly improbable that congress would have bury a general spoliation statute cover object of any and every kind in a provision target fraud in financial the government argue however that we inquiry would be incomplete if we fail to consider the origin of the phrase record document or tangible object congress draw that phrase the government say from a model penal code mpc provision and reform proposal base on that provision the mpc provision and proposal prompt by it would have impose liability on anyone who alter destroy mutilate conceal or remove a record document or thing see ali mpc those proscription be understand to refer to all physical evidence see mpc comment at provision apply to any physical object accordingly the government reason and the dissent exuberantly agree post at congress must have intend to apply to the universe of physical evidence the inference be unwarranted true the mpc provision prohibit tamper with any kind of physical evidence but unlike the mpc provision do not prohibit action that specifically relate to record document and object use to record or preserve information the mpc provision also rank the offense as a misdemeanor and limited liability to instance in which the actor believ e that a official proceeding or investigation be pend or about to be institute mpc at yates would have have scant reason to anticipate a felony prosecution and certainly not one institute at a time when even the smallest of the fish he catch come within the legal limit see supra at bond united states slip at reject boundless reading of a statutory term give deeply serious consequence that reading would entail a propose federal offense in line with the mpc provision advance by a federal commission in be similarly qualify see final report of the national commission on reform of federal criminal laws section conspicuously lack the limit build into the mpc provision and the federal proposal it describe not a misdemeanor but a felony punishable by up to year in prison and the section cover conduct intend to impede any federal investigation or proceeding include one not even on the verge of commencement give these significant difference the meaning of record document or thing in the mpc provision and a kindred proposal be not a reliable indicator of the meaning congress assign to record document or tangible object in the mpc provision in short tell we neither what congress write nor what congress want post at concern yates small fish as the subject of a federal felony prosecution c finally if we recourse to traditional tool of statutory construction leave any doubt about the meaning of tangible object as that term be use in we would invoke the rule that ambiguity concern the ambit of criminal statute should be resolve in favor of lenity cleveland united states quote rewis united states that interpretative principle be relevant here where the government urge a reading of that expose individual to prison sentence for tamper with any physical object that might have evidentiary value in any federal investigation into any offense no matter whether the investigation be pend or merely contemplate or whether the offense subject to investigation be criminal or civil see liparota united states application of the rule of lenity ensure that criminal statute will provide fair warning concern conduct render illegal and strike the appropriate balance between the legislature the prosecutor and the court in define criminal liability in determine the meaning of tangible object in it be appropriate before we choose the harsher alternative to require that congress should have speak in language that be clear and definite see cleveland at quote united states universal credit see also jones united states rule of lenity reinforce the conclusion that arson of a residence be not subject to federal prosecution under i because such a residence do not qualify as property use in commerce or activity for the reason state we resist read expansively to create a coverall spoliation of evidence statute advisable as such a measure might be leave that important decision to congress we hold that a tangible object within compass be one use to record or preserve information the judgment of the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit be therefore reverse and the case be remand for further proceedings it be so order alito concur in judgment john yates petitioner united state on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the eleventh circuit february justice alito concur in the judgment this case can and should be resolve on narrow grounds and though the question be close traditional tool of statutory construction confirm that john yates have the better of the argument three feature of stand out to i the statute list of noun its list of verb and its title although perhaps none of these feature by itself would tip the case in favor of yates the three combine do so start with the noun section refer to any record document or tangible object the noscitur a sociis canon instruct that when a statute contain a list each word in that list presumptively have a similar meaning see gustafson alloyd a related canon ejusdem generis teach that general word follow a list of specific word should usually be read in light of those specific word to mean something similar see christopher smithkline beecham slip at apply these canon to list of noun the term tangible object should refer to something similar to record or document a fish do not spring to mind nor do a antelope a colonial farmhouse a hydrofoil or a oil derrick all be object that be tangible but who would not raise a eyebrow if a neighbor when ask to identify something similar to a record or document say crocodile this reading of course have its shortcoming for instance this be a imperfect ejusdem generi case because record and document be themselves quite general and there be a risk that tangible object may be make superfluous what be similar to a record or document but yet be not one a however could be such a thing see united states sentence commission guideline manual and comment reading record document or tangible object to includ e what be find on magnetic optical digital other electronic or other storage medium or device a after all might not be a document if as be traditionally so a document be a piece of paper with information on it not information store on a computer electronic storage device or any other medium black law dictionary ed might also not be record if record be limit to minute or other formal writings design to memorialize past event at a hard drive however be tangible and can contain file that be precisely akin to even these narrow definition both record and document can be read more expansively but add tangible object to would ensure beyond question that electronic file be include to be sure tangible object presumably can capture more than just congress enact catchall s for know unknown republic of iraq beaty but where noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generi apply know unknown should be similar to known known here record and document this be especially true because reading tangible object too broadly could render record and document superfluous next consider list of verb alter destroy mutilate conceal cover up falsify or make a false entry in although many of those verb could apply to noun as as salamander satellite or sand dune the last phrase in the list make a false entry in make no sense outside of filekeeping how do one make a false entry in a fish alter and especially falsify be also closely associate with filekeeping not one of the verb moreover can not be apply to filekeep certainly not in the way that make a false entry in be always inconsistent with the aquatic again the government be not without a response one can imagine congress try to write a law so broadly that not every verb line up with every noun but failure to line up may suggest that something have go awry in one interpretation of a text where as here each of a statute verb apply to a certain category of noun there be some reason to think that congress have that category in mind category of course be often underinclusive or overinclusive for instance apply to a letter but not a bomb but this do not mean that category be not useful or that congress do not enact they see vance bradley here focus on the verb the category of noun appear to be filekeep this observation be not dispositive but neither be it nothing the government also contend that verb cut both way because it be unnatural to apply falsify to tangible object and that be certainly true one do not falsify the outside casing of a hard drive but one could falsify or alter datum physically record on that hard drive finally my analysis be influence by title destruction alteration or falsification of record in federal investigation and bankruptcy emphasis add this too point toward filekeeping not fish title can be useful device to resolve doubt about the meaning of a statute porter nussle quote united states see also lawson fmr llc sotomayor dissent slip at the title be especially valuable here because it reinforce what the text noun and verb independently suggest that no matter how other statute might be read this particular one do not cover every noun in the universe with tangible form title of course be also not dispositive here if the list of noun do not already suggest that tangible object should mean something similar to record or document especially when read in conjunction with peculiar list of verb with they focus on filekeeping then the title would not be enough on its own in conjunction with those other two textual feature however the government argument though colorable become too implausible to accept see washington state of social and health servs guardianship estate of keffeler focus on the product of two canon of construction which be confirm by other interpretative evidence obama cadc aggregate evidence kagan dissent john yates petitioner united state on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the eleventh circuit february justice kagan with whom justice scalia justice kennedy and justice thomas join dissent a criminal law prohibit tamper with any record document or tangible object in a attempt to obstruct a federal investigation this case raise the question whether the term tangible object mean the same thing in as it mean in everyday language any object capable of be touch the answer should be easy yes the term tangible object be broad but clear throughout the code and many states law it invariably cover physical object of all kind and in context confirm what bare text say all the word surround tangible object show that congress mean the term to have a wide range that fit with congress evident purpose in enact to punish those who alter or destroy physical evidence any physical evidence with the intent of thwart federal law enforcement the plurality instead interpret tangible object to cover only object one can use to record or preserve information ante at the concur opinion similarly if more vaguely contend that tangible object should refer to something similar to record or document and should not include colonial farmhouse crocodile or fish ante at alito concur in judgment in my view conventional tool of statutory construction all lead to a more conventional result a tangible object be a object that be tangible i would apply the statute that congress enact and affirm the judgment below i while the plurality start its analysis with head see ante at we note first caption i would begin with text when congress have not supply a definition we generally give a statutory term its ordinary meaning see schindler elevator united states ex rel kirk slip at as the plurality must acknowledge the ordinary meaning of tangible object be a discrete thing that possess physical form ante at punctuation and citation omit a fish be of course a discrete thing that possess physical form see generally seuss one fish two fish red fish blue fish so the ordinary meaning of the term tangible object in as no one here dispute cover fish include red grouper that interpretation accord with endless use of

a d define museum as entity that own tangible object that be exhibit to the public b allow discovery of relevant fact book papers document or tangible thing to my knowledge no court have ever read any such provision to exclude thing that do not record or preserve datum rather all court have adhere to the statutory language ordinary expansive meaning for example court have understand the phrase tangible object and tangible thing in the federal rule of criminal and civil procedure to cover everything from gun to drug to machinery to animal see united states obiukwu per curiam handgun united

the same way see united states mcrae corpse united states maury cement mixer that be not necessarily the end of the matter i agree with the plurality really who do not that context matter in interpret statute we do not construe the meaning of statutory term in a vacuum tyler cain rather we interpret particular word in they context and with a view to they place in the overall statutory scheme davis michigan of treasury and sometimes that mean as the plurality say that the dictionary definition of a disputed term can not control see bloate united states but this be not such a occasion for here the text and its context point the same way step back from the word tangible object provide only further evidence that congress say what it mean and mean what it say begin with the way the surround

variety see united states rodgers reject a narrow technical definition of a statutory term when it clash strongly with sweep language in the same sentence still more tangible object appear as part of

word record document or tangible object in also track language in the federal law cover as even the plurality accept see ante at physical evidence in all its form section both in its original version precede and today repeatedly use the phrase record document or other object most notably in a provision prohibit the use of force or threat to induce another person to withhold any of those material from a official proceeding a of the victim and witness protection act of stat as amend b that language which itself likely derive from the model penal code encompass no less the bloody knife than the incriminate letter as all court have for decade agree see united states kellington boat united states applewhaite stone wall and typically only the most compelling evidence will persuade this court that congress intend nearly identical language in provision deal with related subject to bear different meaning communication worker beck see scalia garner reading law the interpretation of legal text context thus again confirm what text indicate and legislative history for those who care about it put extra icing on a cake already frost section as the plurality note see ante at be enact after the enron corporation collapse as part of the act of stat but the provision begin its life in a separate bill and the drafter emphasize that enron be only a case study expose the shortcoming in we current law relate to both corporate and criminal fraud the primary loophole congress identify see at arise from limit in the part of just describe that provision as uniformly construe prohibit a person from induce another to destroy record s document s or other object s of every type but not from do so himself b see supra at congress as even the plurality agree see ante at enact to close that yawn gap but could fully achieve that goal only if it cover all the record document and object do as well as all the means of tamper with they and so be write to do exactly that to apply broadly to any act to destroy or fabricate physical evidence as long as perform with the requisite intent at when a person destroy evidence the drafter explain overly technical legal distinction should neither hinder nor prevent prosecution at ah well congress meet today court which here invent just such a distinction with just such a effect see united states philadelphia nat bank c reat ing a large loophole in a statute design to close a loophole be illogical and disrespectful of congressional purpose as congress recognize in use a broad term give immunity to those who destroy evidence have no sensible basis in penal policy a person who hide a murder victim body be no less culpable than one who burn the victim diary a fisherman like john yates who dump undersized fish to avoid a fine be no less blameworthy than one who shred he vessel catch log for the same reason congress thus treat both offender in the same way it understand in enact that destroy evidence be destroy evidence whether or not that evidence take documentary form ii a the plurality search far and wide for anything anything to support its interpretation of but its fishing expedition come up empty the plurality analysis start with title destruction alteration or falsification of record in federal investigation and bankruptcy see ante at see also ante at opinion of alito that be already a sign something be amiss i know of no other case in which we have begin we interpretation of a statute with the title or rely on a title to override the law clear term instead we have follow the wise rule that the title of a statute and the head of a section can not limit the plain meaning of the text trainmen baltimore ohio the reason for that wise rule be easy to see a title be almost necessarily a abridgment attempt to mention every term in a statute would often be ungainly as well as useless accordingly matter in the text be frequently unreflected in the heading at just last year this court observe that two title in a nearby section of serve as but a reference to the general subject matter of the provision at issue not mean to take the place of the detailed provision of the text lawson fmr llc slip at quote trainmen at the of the heading we state be apparent lawson at slip at so too for title which refer to destruction alteration or falsification but not to mutilation concealment or cover up and likewise mention record but not other document or object presumably the plurality would not refuse to apply when a person only conceal evidence rather than destroy alter or falsify it instead the plurality would say that a title be just a title which can not undo or limit more specific statutory text ibid quote trainmen at the same hold true when the evidence in question be not a record but something else whose destruction alteration be intend to obstruct justice the plurality next try to divine meaning from position within chapter of title ante at but that move be yet odder than the last as far as i can tell this court have never once suggest that the section number assign to a law bear upon its meaning scalia supra at list more than interpretive principle and canon without mention the plurality new theory and even on its own term the plurality argument be hard to fathom the plurality claim that if apply to object generally congress would not have place it after the and because those be specialized provision ante at but search i if i can find a better place for a broad ban on the plurality seem to agree that the law properly go in chapter the criminal code chapter on obstruction of justice but the provision do not logically fit into any of that chapter section and with the first number of the chapter already take start with and continue through the law naturally take the place that be standard operating procedure prior to the act of all of chapter be order chronologically section be later enact than which be later enact than which be well you get the idea and after congress have continue in the same vein section be thus right where you would expect it as be the contemporaneously pass between add in and add in the plurality third argument rely on the surplusage canon at least invoke a known tool of statutory construction but it too come to nothing say the plurality if read naturally would render superfluous c which congress pass as part of the same act ante at but that be not so although the two provision significantly overlap each apply to conduct the other do not the key difference between the two be that protect the integrity of matter s within the jurisdiction of any federal department or agency whereas c safeguard official proceeding s as define in a a section language often apply more broadly than c as the plurality note for example a fbi investigation count as a matter within a federal department jurisdiction but fall outside the statutory definition of official proceeding as construe by court see united states gabriel but conversely c sometimes reach more widely than for example because a official proceeding include any proceed before a judge or court of the united states c prohibit tamper with evidence in federal litigation between private party see a a united states burge united states reich sotomayor by contrast would not ordinarily operate in that context because a federal court be not a department or agency see hubbard united states so the surplusage canon do not come into play overlap even significant overlap abound in the criminal law see loughrin united states slip at this court have never think that of such ordinary stuff surplusage be make see connecticut nat bank germain and the legislative history to which the plurality appeal see ante at only cut against it because those material show that lawmaker know that and c share much common ground minority leader lott introduce the amendment that include c along with other criminal and corporate fraud provision late in the legislative process explain that he do so at the specific request of the president see cong rec remark of lott not only lott but several other senator note the overlap between the president package and provision already in the bill most notably see at remark of lott at remark of biden at remark of hatch and gramm the presence of both and c in the final act may have reflect caution if contain some flaw c would serve as a backstop or the addition of c may have derive solely from legislator wish to satisfy audience other than court that be the president and he justice department gluck bressman statutory interpretation from the inside stan emphasis delete whichever the case congress consciousness of overlap between the two provision remove any conceivable reason to cast aside ordinary meaning in service of prevent some statutory repetition indeed the inclusion of c in create a far worse problem for the plurality construction of than for mine section c criminalize the destruction of any record document or other object of any record document or tangible object on the plurality view one object be really a object whereas the other be only a object that preserve or store information but t he normal rule of statutory construction assume that identical word use in different part of the same act pass at the same time be intend to have the same meaning sorenson secretary of treasury internal quotation mark omit and that be especially true when the different provision pertain to the same subject see supra at the plurality do not really can not explain why it instead interpret the same word use in two provision of the same act address the same basic problem to mean fundamentally different thing get nowhere with surplusage the plurality switch canon hope that noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generi will save it see ante at see also ante at opinion of alito the first of those related canon advise that word group in a list be give similar meaning the second counsel that a general term follow specific word embrace only thing of a similar kind accord to the plurality those latin maxim change the english meaning of tangible object to only thing like record and document use to record or preserve information ante at but understand as this court always have the canon have no such transformative effect on the workaday language congress choose as a initial matter this court use noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generi to resolve ambiguity not create it those principle be useful rule s of construction where word be of obscure or doubtful meaning russell motor car united states but when word have a clear definition and all other contextual clue support that meaning the canon can not properly defeat congress decision to draft broad legislation see ali at reject the invocation of these canon as a attempt to create ambiguity where the statute text and structure suggest none anyway assign tangible object its ordinary meaning comport with noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generi when apply as they should be with attention to subject and purpose those canon require identify a common trait that link all the word in a statutory phrase see graham county soil and water conservation dist united states ex rel wilson ali at in respond to that demand the plurality characterize record and document as thing that preserve information and so they be but just as much they be thing that provide information and thus potentially serve as evidence relevant to matter under review and in a statute pertain to obstruction of federal investigation that evidentiary function come to the fore the destruction of record and document prevent law enforcement agent from gather fact relevant to official inquiry and so too do the destruction of tangible object of whatever kind whether the item be a fisherman ledger or a undersized fish throw it overboard have the identical effect on the administration of justice see supra at for purpose of record document and all tangible object be therefore alike indeed even the plurality can not fully credit its argument the same reasoning would apply to every law place the word object or thing after record and document but as note earlier such statute be common the phrase appear among other place in many state law base on the model penal code as well as in multiple provision of see supra at the plurality accept that in those law object means object its argument about superfluity positively depend on give c that broader reading see ante at what then be the difference here the plurality propose that some of those statute describe less serious offens than see ante at how and why that distinction affect application of the noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generi canon be leave obscure count it as one more of the plurality interpretive theory see supra at but in any event that rationale can not support the plurality willingness to give object its natural meaning in which like set out felony with penalty of up to year see a c b c the canon in the plurality interpretive world apparently switch on and off whenever convenient and the plurality invocation of verb do nothing to buttress its argument see ante at ante at opinion of alito the plurality observe that prohibit falsif ye or mak ing a false entry in a tangible object and no one can do those thing to say a murder weapon or a fish ante at but of course someone can alter destroy mutilate conceal or cover up such a tangible object and prohibit those action too the court have never before suggest that all the verb in a statute need to match up with all the noun see robers united states slip at t he law do not require legislator to write extra language specifically exempt phrase by phrase application in respect to which a portion of a phrase be not need and for good reason it be exactly when congress set out to draft a statute broadly to include every imaginable variation on a theme that such mismatch will arise to respond by narrow the law as the plurality do be thus to flout both what congress write and what congress want finally when all else fail the plurality invoke the rule of lenity see ante at but even in its most robust form that rule only kick in when after all legitimate tool of interpretation have be exhaust a reasonable doubt persist regard whether congress have make the defendant conduct a federal crime abramski united states scalia dissent slip at quote moskal united states no such doubt linger here the plurality point to the breadth of see ante at as though breadth be equivalent to ambiguity it be not section be very broad it be also very clear every traditional tool of statutory interpretation point in the same direction toward object mean object lenity offer no proper refuge from that straightforward even though capacious construction b the concur opinion be a shorter vaguer version of the plurality it rely primarily on the noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generi canon try to bolster they with list of verb and conclude with the section title see supra at address each of those argument notably even the concurrence put no stock in the plurality and superfluity claim from those familiar material the concurrence arrive at the follow definition tangible object should mean something similar to record or document ante at opinion of alito in amplify that purported guidance the concurrence suggest apply the term tangible object in keep with what a neighbor when ask to identify something similar to record or document might answer ante at w ho would not raise a eyebrow the concurrence wonder if the neighbor say crocodile ante at court sometimes say when explain the latin maxim that the word of a statute should be interpret consistent with they neighbor see united states locke the concurrence take that expression literally but meaning should not hinge on the odd game of mad libs the concurrence propose no one reading need to fill in a blank after the word record and document that be because congress quite helpfully already do so add the term tangible object the issue in this case be what that term mean so if the concurrence wish to ask its neighbor a question i would recommend a more pertinent one do you think a fish or if the concurrence prefer a crocodile be a tangible object as to that query who would not raise a eyebrow if the neighbor say no in insist on its different question the concurrence neglect the proper function of catchall phrase like or tangible object the reason congress use such term be precisely to reach thing that in the concurrence word do not spring to mind to my mind to my neighbor or most important to congress ante at opinion of alito as this court recently explain t he whole value of a generally phrased residual term be that it serve as a catchall for matter not specifically contemplate known unknown beaty at congress realize that in a game of free association with record and document it will never think of all the other thing include crocodile and fish whose destruction or alteration can less frequently but just as effectively thwart law enforcement united states stubbs dead crocodile use as evidence to support smuggling conviction and so congress add the general term or tangible object again exactly because such thing do not spring to mind the concurrence suggest that the term tangible object serve not as a catchall for physical evidence but to ensure beyond question that and other electronic file fall within compass ante at but that claim be in its own right would a congress wish to make certain that apply to add the phrase tangible object as oppose say to electronic communication would a judge or jury member predictably find that tangible object encompass something as virtual as as compare say with something as real as a fish if not and the answer be not then that term can not function as a failsafe for the concurrence acknowledge that no one of its argument can carry the day rather it take the latin canon plus verb plus title to tip the case for yates ante at but the sum total of three mistaken argument be three mistaken argument they do not get better in the combine and so the concurrence end up right where the plurality do except that the concurrence eschew the rule of lenity have nothing to fall back on iii if none of the traditional tool of statutory interpretation can produce today result then what account for it the plurality offer a clue when it emphasize the disproportionate penalty impose if the law be read broadly see ante at section the plurality object would then expose individual to prison sentence for tamper with any physical object that might have evidentiary value in any federal investigation into any offense ante at that bring to the surface the real issue overcriminalization and excessive punishment in the code now as to this statute i think the plurality somewhat though only somewhat exaggerate the matter the plurality omit from its description of the requirement that a person act knowingly and with the intent to impede obstruct or influence federal law enforcement and in highlight maximum penalty the plurality gloss over the absence of any prescribe minimum let not forget that yates sentence be not year but day congress presumably enact law with high maximum and no minimum when it think the prohibit conduct may run the gamut from major to minor that be assuredly true of act obstruct justice compare this case with the follow all of which properly come within but now fall outside mcrae at burn human body to thwart murder investigation maury at alter cement mixer to impede inquiry into amputation of employee finger united states natal dist lexis d repaint van to cover up evidence of fatal arson most district judge as congress know will recognize difference between such case and prosecution like this one and will try to make the punishment fit the crime still and all i tend to think for the reason the plurality give that be a bad law too broad and undifferentiated with maximum penalty which give prosecutor too much leverage and sentencer too much discretion and i would go further in those way be unfortunately not a outlier but a emblem of a deeper pathology in the federal criminal code but whatever the wisdom or folly of this court do not get to rewrite the law resolution of the pro and con of whether a statute should sweep broadly or narrowly be for congress rodgers at if judge disagree with congress choice we be perfectly entitle to say so in lecture in law review article and even in dictum but we be not entitle to replace the statute congress enact with a alternative of we own design i respectfully dissent footnote footnote yates be also charge with make a false sta
