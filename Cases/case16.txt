this case involve the intersection of two federal statute the lanham act permit one competitor to sue another for unfair competition arise from false or misleading product description the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca prohibit the misbranding of food and drink f to implement the fdca provision the food and drug administration fda have promulgate regulation regard food and beverage labeling include one concern juice blend unlike the lanham act which rely in large part for its enforcement on private suit bring by injured competitor the fdca and its regulation give the united states nearly exclusive enforcement authority and do not permit private enforcement suit the fdca also certain state misbranding law petitioner pom wonderful llc which produce market and sell inter alia a juice blend file a lanham act suit against respondent company allege that the name label marketing and advertising of one of juice blend mislead consumer into believe the product consist predominantly of pomegranate and blueberry juice when it in fact consist predominantly of less expensive apple and grape juice and that the ensue confusion cause pom to lose sale the district court grant partial summary judgment to rule that the fdca and its regulation preclude lanham act challenge to the name and label of juice blend the ninth circuit affirm in relevant part hold competitor may bring lanham act claim like pom challenging food and beverage label regulate by the fdca a this result be base on the follow premise first this be not a case for it do not raise the question whether state law be by a federal law see wyeth levine but instead concern the alleged preclusion of a cause of action under one federal statute by the provision of another federal statute principle may nonetheless be instructive insofar as they be design to assess the interaction of law bear on the same subject second this be a statutory interpretation case and analysis of the statutory text aid by established interpretation rule control see chickasaw nation united states while a principle of interpretation may be counter by some maxim point in a different direction circuit city stores adams this court need not decide what maxim establish the proper framework here even assume that be correct that the court task be to reconcile or harmonize the statute instead of to determine whether one statute be a implied repeal in part of another statute be incorrect that the best way to do that be to bar pom lanham act claim b neither the lanham act nor the fdca in express term forbid or limit lanham act claim challenging label that be regulate by the fdca the absence of such a textual provision when the lanham act and the fdca have coexist for over year be powerful evidence that congress do not intend fda oversight to be the exclusive means of ensure proper food and beverage labeling see wyeth supra at in addition and contrary to argument congress by take care to only some state law if anything indicate it do not intend the fdca to preclude requirement arise from other source see setser united states the structure of the fdca and the lanham act reinforce this conclusion where two statute be complementary it would show disregard for the congressional design to hold that congress intend one federal statute nonetheless to preclude the operation of the other see ag supply pioneer int l the lanham act and the fdca complement each other in major respects for each have its own scope and purpose both touch on food and beverage labeling but the lanham act protect commercial interest against unfair competition while the fdca protect public health and safety they also complement each other with respect to remedy the fdca enforcement be largely commit to the fda while the lanham act empower private party to sue competitor to protect they interest on a basis allow lanham act suit take advantage of synergy among multiple method of regulation a hold that the fdca preclude lanham act claim challenging food and beverage label also could lead to a result that congress likely do not intend the fda do not necessarily pursue enforcement measure regard all objectionable label preclusion of lanham act claim could leave commercial interest and indirectly the public at large with less effective protection in the food and beverage labeling realm than in other less regulated industry c argument do not support its claim that preclusion be proper because congress intend national uniformity in food and beverage labeling first the fdca delegation of enforcement authority to the federal government do not indicate that congress intend to foreclose private enforcement of other federal statute second the fdca express provision apply by its term to state not federal law even if it be proper to stray from that text it not clear that national uniformity assertion reflect the congressional design finally the fdca and its implement regulation may address food and beverage labeling with more specificity than the lanham act but this specificity would matter only if the two act can not be implement in full at the same time here neither the statutory structure nor the empirical evidence of which the court be aware indicate there will be any difficulty in fully enforce each statute accord to its term d the government intermediate position that a lanham act claim be preclude to the extent the fdca or fda regulation specifically require or authorize the challenge aspect of the label and that this rule preclude pom challenge to the name of product be flaw for the government assume that the fdca and its regulation be a ceiling on the regulation of food and beverage labeling when congress intend the lanham act and the fdca to complement each other with respect to labeling though the fda rulemake allude at one point to a balance of interest it neither discuss nor cite the lanham act and the government point to no other statement suggest that the fda consider the full scope of interest protect by the lanham act even if agency regulation with the force of law that purport to bar other legal remedy may do so it be a bridge too far to accept a agency statement to justify that result here a agency may not reorder federal statutory rights without congressional authorization reverse and remand kennedy deliver the opinion of the court in which all other member join except breyer who take no part in the consideration or decision of the case opinion of the court notice this opinion be subject to formal revision before publication in the preliminary print of the united states reports reader be request to notify the reporter of decision supreme court of the united states washington of any typographical or other formal error in order that correction may be make before the preliminary print go to press pom wonderful llc petitioner v the company on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the ninth circuit june justice kennedy deliver the opinion of the court pom wonderful llc make and sell pomegranate juice product include a juice blend app one of pom competitor be the company minute maid division make a juice blend sell with a label that in describe the contents display the word pomegranate blueberry with far more prominence than other word on the label that show the juice to be a blend of five juice in truth the product contain but pomegranate juice and blueberry juice allege that the use of that label be deceptive and misleading pom sue under of the lanham act stat as amend that provision allow one competitor to sue another if it allege unfair competition arise from false or misleading product description the court of appeals for the ninth circuit hold that in the realm of label for food and beverage a lanham act claim like pom be preclude by a second federal statute the second statute be the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca which forbid the misbranding of food include by means of false or misleading labeling stat as amend the ruling that pom lanham act cause of action be preclude by the fdca be incorrect there be no statutory text or establish interpretive principle to support the contention that the fdca preclude lanham act suit like the one bring by pom in this case nothing in the text history or structure of the fdca or the lanham act show the congressional purpose or design to forbid these suit quite to the contrary the fdca and the lanham act complement each other in the federal regulation of misleading food and beverage label competitor in they own interest may bring lanham act claim like pom that challenge food and beverage label that be regulate by the fdca i a this case concern the intersection and of these two federal law a proper beginning point be a description of the statute congress enact the lanham act nearly seven decade ago see stat as the court explain earlier this term it require no guesswork to ascertain congress intent regard this federal law for congress include a detailed statement of the statute purpose lexmark int l static control components slip at section of the lanham act provide the intent of this chapter be to regulate commerce within the control of congress by make actionable the deceptive and misleading use of mark in such commerce to protect registered mark use in such commerce from interference by state or territorial legislation to protect person engage in such commerce against unfair competition to prevent fraud and deception in such commerce by the use of reproduction copy counterfeit or colorable imitation of register mark and to provide rights and remedy stipulate by treaty and convention respect trademark trade name and unfair competition enter into between the united states and foreign nation the lanham act trademark provision be the primary means of achieve these end but the act also create a federal remedy that go beyond trademark protection dastar twentieth century fox film the broader remedy be at issue here the lanham act create a cause of action for unfair competition through misleading advertising or labeling though in the end consumer also benefit from the act proper enforcement the cause of action be for competitor not consumer the term competitor be use in this opinion to indicate all those within the class of person and entity protect by the lanham act competitor be within the class that may invoke the lanham act because they may suffer a injury to a commercial interest in sale or business reputation proximately cause by a defendant misrepresentation lexmark supra at slip at the petitioner here assert injury as a competitor the cause of action the act create impose civil liability on any person who use in commerce any word term name symbol or device or any combination thereof or any false designation of origin false or misleading description of fact or false or misleading representation of fact which misrepresent the nature characteristic quality or geographic origin of he or she or another person goods service or commercial activity a as the court hold this term the private remedy may be invoke only by those who allege a injury to a commercial interest in reputation or sale a consumer who be hoodwink into purchase a disappointing product may well have a cognizable under article iii but he can not invoke the protection of the lanham act lexmark at slip at this principle reflect the lanham act purpose of protect ing person engage in commerce within the control of congress against unfair competition at slip at pom cause of action would be straightforward enough but for contention that a separate federal statutory regime the fdca allow it to use the label in question and in fact preclude the lanham act claim so the fdca be the second statute to be discuss the fdca statutory regime be design primarily to protect the health and safety of the public at large see case of jam united states fdca stat agency may issue certain regulation to promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumer the fdca prohibit the misbranding of food and drink f a food or drink be deem misbrand if inter alia its labeling be false or misleading a information require to appear on its label be not prominently place thereon f or a label do not bear the common or usual name of the food if any there be i to implement these provision the food and drug administration fda promulgate regulation regard food and beverage labeling include the labeling of mix of different type of juice into one juice blend see cfr one provision of those regulation be particularly relevant to this case if a juice blend do not name all the juice it contain and mention only juice that be not predominant in the blend then it must either declare the percentage content of the name juice or i ndicate that the name juice be present as a flavor or flavoring raspberry and cranberry flavored juice drink d the government represent that the fda do not preapprove juice label under these regulation see brief for united states as amicus curiae in opposition that contrast with the fda regulation of other type of label such as drug label see d and be consistent with the less extensive role the fda play in the regulation of food than in the regulation of drug unlike the lanham act which rely in substantial part for its enforcement on private suit bring by injured competitor the fdca and its regulation provide the united states with nearly exclusive enforcement include the authority to seek criminal sanction in some circumstance a private party may not bring enforcement suit also unlike the lanham act the fdca contain a provision certain state law on misbranding that provision which congress add to the fdca in the nutrition label and education act of stat foreclose a state or political subdivision of a state from establish requirement that be of the type but not identical to the requirement in some of the misbranding provision of the fdca a it do not address or refer to other federal statute or the preclusion thereof b pom wonderful llc be a grower of pomegranate and a distributor of pomegranate juice through its pom wonderful brand pom produce market and sell a variety of pomegranate product include a juice blend app pom compete in the juice market with the company under its minute maid brand create a juice blend contain apple and grape juice pomegranate juice blueberry juice and raspberry juice at brief for respondent despite the minuscule amount of pomegranate and blueberry juice in the blend the front label of the product display the word pomegranate blueberry in all capital letter on two separate line app below those word place the phrase flavored blend of juice in much smaller type ibid and below that phrase in still smaller type be the word from concentrate with add ingredient and with a line break before the final phrase and other natural flavor ibid the product front label also display a vignette of blueberry grape and raspberry in front of a halved pomegranate and a halved apple ibid claim that label trick and deceive consumer all to pom injury as a competitor pom bring suit under the lanham act pom allege that the name label marketing and advertising of juice blend mislead consumer into believe the product consist predominantly of pomegranate and blueberry juice when it in fact consist predominantly of less expensive apple and grape juice at that confusion pom complain cause it to lose sale at pom seek damages and injunctive relief at the district court grant partial summary judgment to on pom lanham act claim rule that the fdca and its regulation preclude challenge to the name and label of juice blend the district court reason that in the juice blend regulation the fda have directly speak on the issue that form the basis of pom lanham act claim against the naming and labeling of product but have not prohibit any and indeed expressly have permit some aspect of label supp cd cal the court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirm in relevant part like the district court the court of appeals reason that congress decide to entrust matter of juice beverage label to the fda the fda have promulgate comprehensive regulation of that labeling and the fda apparently have not impose the requirement on label that be seek by pom u nder circuit precedent the court of appeals explain for a court to act when the fda have not despite regulate extensively in this area would risk undercut the fda expert judgment and authority at for these reason and o ut of respect for the statutory and regulatory scheme the court of appeals bar pom lanham act claim at ii a this court grant certiorari to consider whether a private party may bring a lanham act claim challenge a food label that be regulate by the fdca the answer to that question be base on the follow premise first this be not a case in case the question be whether state law be by a federal statute or in some instance a federal agency action see wyeth levine this case however concern the alleged preclusion of a cause of action under one federal statute by the provision of another federal statute so the balance do not frame the inquiry because this be a preclusion case any presumption against at have no force in addition the preclusion analysis be not govern by the court complex categorization of the type of see crosby national foreign trade council although the court precedent do not govern preclusion analysis in this case its principle be instructive insofar as they be design to assess the interaction of law that bear on the same subject second this be a statutory interpretation case and the court rely on traditional rule of statutory interpretation that do not change because the case involve multiple federal statute see fda brown williamson tobacco nor do it change because a agency be involve see ibid analysis of the statutory text aid by established principle of interpretation control see chickasaw nation united states a principle of interpretation be often counter of course by some maxim point in a different direction circuit city stores adams it be thus unsurprising that in this case a threshold dispute have arise as to which of two compete maxim establish the proper framework for decision pom argue that this case concern whether one statute the fdca as amend be a imply repeal in part of statute the lanham act see carcieri salazar pom contend that in such case court must give full effect to both statute unless they be in irreconcilable conflict see and that this high standard be not satisfy here resist this canon and its high standard argue that the case concern whether a more specific law the fdca clarify or narrow the scope of a more general law the lanham act see united states fausto brief for respondent the court task it claim be to reconcil e the law and it say the best reconciliation be that the more specific provision of the fdca bar certain cause of action authorize in a general manner by the lanham act the court do not need to resolve this dispute even assume that be correct that the court task be to reconcile or harmonize the statute and not as pom urge to enforce both statute in full unless there be a genuinely irreconcilable conflict be incorrect that the best way to harmonize the statute be to bar pom lanham act claim b begin with the text of the two statute it must be observe that neither the lanham act nor the fdca in express term forbid or limit lanham act claim challenging label that be regulate by the fdca by its term the lanham act subject to suit any person who misrepresent the nature characteristic quality or geographic origin of goods or service a this comprehensive imposition of liability extend by its own term to misrepresentation on label include food and beverage label no other provision in the lanham act limit that understand or purport to govern the relevant interaction between the lanham act and the fdca and the fdca by its term do not preclude lanham act suit in consequence food and beverage label regulate by the fdca be not under the term of either statute off limit to lanham act claim no textual provision in either statute disclose a purpose to bar unfair competition claim like pom this absence be of special significance because the lanham act and the fdca have coexist since the passage of the lanham act in stat ch stat if congress have conclude in light of experience that lanham act suit could interfere with the fdca it might well have enact a provision address the issue during these year see wyeth supra at if congress think suit pose a obstacle to its objective it surely would have enact a express provision at some point during the fdca history congress enact amendment to the fdca and the lanham act see nutrition label and education act of stat trademark law revision act of stat include a amendment that add to the fdca a express provision with respect to state law address food and beverage misbranding stat yet congress do not enact a provision address the preclusion of other federal law that might bear on food and beverage labeling this be powerful evidence that congress do not intend fda oversight to be the exclusive means of ensure proper food and beverage labeling see wyeth at perhaps the closest the statute come to address the preclusion of the lanham act claim at issue here be the provision add to the fdca in as part of the nutrition label and education act see but far from expressly preclude suit arise under other federal law the provision if anything suggest that lanham act suit be not preclude this provision forbid a state or political subdivision of a state from impose requirement that be of the type but not identical to corresponding fdca requirement for food and beverage labeling ibid it be significant that the complex provision distinguish among different fdca requirement it forbid requirement that be of the type but not identical to only certain fdca provision with respect to food and beverage labeling see a cite some but not all of the subsection of stat codify at and note following just as significant the provision do not refer to requirement impose by other source of law such as federal statute for purpose of decide whether the fdca displace a regulatory or liability scheme in another statute it make a substantial difference whether that other statute be state or federal by take care to mandate express of some state law congress if anything indicate it do not intend the fdca to preclude requirement arise from other source see setser united states slip at apply principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius of some state requirement do not suggest a intent to preclude federal claim the structure of the fdca and the lanham act reinforce the conclusion draw from the text when two statute complement each other it would show disregard for the congressional design to hold that congress nonetheless intend one federal statute to preclude the operation of the other see ag supply pioneer int l w e can plainly regard each statute as effective because of its different requirement and protection see also wyeth supra at the lanham act and the fdca complement each other in major respects for each have its own scope and purpose although both statute touch on food and beverage labeling the lanham act protect commercial interest against unfair competition while the fdca protect public health and safety compare lexmark at slip at with case of jam at the two statute impose different requirement and protection ag supply supra at the two statute complement each other with respect to remedy in a more fundamental respect enforcement of the fdca and the detailed prescription of its implement regulation be largely commit to the fda the fda however do not have the same perspective or expertise in assess market dynamics that competitor possess competitor who manufacture or distribute product have detail knowledge regard how consumer rely upon certain sale and marketing strategy they awareness of unfair competition may be far more immediate and accurate than that of agency rulemaker and regulator lanham act suit draw upon this market expertise by empower private party to sue competitor to protect they interest on a basis by serv ing a distinct compensatory function that may motivate injured person to come forward lanham act suit to the extent they touch on the same subject matter as the fdca provide incentive for manufacturer to behave well see at allow lanham act suit take advantage of synergy among multiple method of regulation this be quite consistent with the congressional design to enact two different statute each with its own mechanism to enhance the
