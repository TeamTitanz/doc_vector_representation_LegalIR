silvicultural rule petitioner west have a contract with oregon to harvest timber from a state forest when it rain water run off two log road use by petitioner into ditch culvert and channel that discharge the water into nearby river and stream the discharge often contain large amount of sediment which evidence show may be harmful to fish and other aquatic organism respondent northwest environmental defense center nedc file suit against petitioner and state and local government and official include petitioner decker invoke the act provision and allege that the defendant have not obtain npdes permit before discharge stormwater runoff into two oregon river the district court dismiss the action for failure to state a claim conclude that npdes permit be not require because the ditch culvert and channel be not point source of pollution under the act and the silvicultural rule the ninth circuit reverse it hold that the conveyance be point source under the silvicultural rule it also conclude that the discharge be associate with industrial activity under the industrial stormwater rule despite the epa contrary conclusion that the regulation exclude the type of stormwater discharge from log road at issue thus the court hold the discharge be not exempt from the npdes permit scheme hold a provision of the act govern challenge to agency action b be not a jurisdictional bar to this suit that provision be the exclusive vehicle for suit seek to invalidate certain agency decision such as the establishment of effluent standard and the issuance of permit it do not bar a district court from entertain a citizen suit under when the suit be against a alleged violator and seek to enforce a obligation impose by the act or its regulation the present action fall within the scope of the epa recent amendment to the industrial stormwater rule do not make the case moot a live controversy continue to exist regard whether petitioner may be hold liable for unlawful discharge under the earlier version of the industrial stormwater rule that version govern petitioner past discharge which might be the basis for the imposition of penalty even if in the future those type of discharge will not require a permit these case thus remain live and justiciable see gwaltney of smithfield chesapeake bay foundation the fact that the district court might rule that nedc argument lack merit or that relief be not warrant on the fact of these case do not make the case moot the preamendment version of the industrial stormwater rule as permissibly construe by the epa exempt discharge of channel stormwater runoff from log road from the npdes permit scheme the regulation be a reasonable interpretation of the statutory term associate with industrial activity p b and the agency have construe the regulation to exempt the discharge at issue here when a agency interpret its own regulation the court as a general rule defer to it unless that interpretation be plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation chase bank usa mccoy quote auer robbins here it be reasonable for the epa to conclude that the conveyance at issue be directly related only to the harvesting of raw material rather than to manufacturing processing or raw material storage area at a industrial plant cfr b the regulatory scheme take as a whole leave open the rational interpretation that the regulation extend only to traditional industrial building such as factory and associate site and other relatively fix facility another reason to accord auer deference to the epa interpretation be that there be no indication that the agency current view be a change from prior practice or be a post hoc justification adopt in response to litigation see christopher smithkline beecham rather the epa have be consistent in its view that the type of discharge at issue do not require npdes permit its decision also exist against a background of state regulation with respect to stormwater runoff from log road in exercise the broad discretion the act give the epa in the realm of stormwater runoff the agency could reasonably have conclude that further federal regulation would be duplicative or counterproductive in light of oregon extensive rule on the subject reverse and remand kennedy deliver the opinion of the court in which roberts and thomas ginsburg alito sotomayor and kagan join and

whether the clean water act act and its implement regulation require permit before channel stormwater runoff from log road can be discharge into the navigable water of the united states under the statute and its implement regulation a permit be require if the discharge be deem to be associate with industrial activity p b the environmental protection agency epa with the responsibility to enforce the act have issue a regulation define the term associate with industrial activity to cover only discharge from any conveyance that be use for collect and convey storm water and that be directly relate to manufacturing processing or raw material storage area at a industrial plant cfr b the epa interpret its regulation to exclude the type of stormwater discharge from log road at issue here see brief for united states as amicus curiae for reason now to be explain the court conclude the epa determination be a reasonable interpretation of its own regulation and in consequence deference be accord to the interpretation under auer robbins i a congress pass the clean water act in to restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nation water stat a a central provision of the act be its requirement that individual corporation and government secure national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit before discharge pollution from any point source into the navigable water of the united states see a epa california ex rel state water resources control the act define point source as any discernible confine and discrete conveyance include but not limit to any pipe ditch channel tunnel conduit well discrete fissure container roll stock concentrate animal feeding operation or vessel or other float craft from which pollutant be or may be discharge this term do not include agricultural stormwater discharge and return flow from irrigated agriculture when the act take effect the epa find it difficult to process permit application from countless owner and operator of point source throughout the country the agency issue regulation exempt certain type of discharge from the npdes permit scheme but in those directive be find invalid the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit rule that the statute do not give the epa authority to exempt category of point source from the permit requirement of the act natural resources defense council costle in response the epa issue new regulation to define with more precision which category of discharge qualify as point source in the first place among these regulation be the silvicultural rule this rule be at issue here it provide silvicultural point source mean any discernible confine and discrete conveyance relate to rock crush gravel wash log sorting or log storage facility which be operate in connection with silvicultural activity and from which pollutant be discharge into water of the united states the term do not include source silvicultural activity such as nursery operation site preparation reforestation and subsequent cultural treatment thin prescribe burning pest and fire control harvest operation surface drainage or road construction and maintenance from which there be natural runoff cfr b under the quote rule any discharge from a source that qualify as a point source require a npdes permit unless some other federal statutory provision exempt it from that coverage in one such provision p congress have exempt certain discharge of stormwater runoff the statutory exemption be consider necessary because from the outset the epa have encounter recur difficulty in determine how best to manage discharge of this kind see natural resources defense council epa in congress respond to these problem and adopt various amendment to the act stat p the amendment exempt from the npdes permit scheme most discharge compose entirely of stormwater p the general exemption however do not extend to all stormwater discharge as relevant here congress direct the epa to continue to require permit for stormwater discharge associate with industrial activity p b the statute do not define that term but the epa adopt a regulation hereinafter industrial stormwater rule in which it define it as the discharge from any conveyance that be use for collect and convey storm water and that be directly relate to manufacturing processing or raw material storage area at a industrial plant the term do not include discharge from facility or activity exclude from the npdes program under this part for the category of industry identify in this section the term include but be not limit to storm water discharge from immediate access road and rail line use or travel by carrier of raw material manufacture product waste material or use or create by the facility cfr b the industrial stormwater rule also specify that with one exception not relevant here f acility classify as standard industrial classificatio n be consider to be engage in industrial

be argue in this court the epa issue its final version of a amendment to the industrial stormwater rule the amendment be the agency response to the court of appeals ruling now under review the amend version seek to clarify the type of facility within standard industrial classification that be deem to be engage in industrial activity for purpose of the rule the amend industrial stormwater rule do not cover all facility within standard industrial classification it limit covered stormwater discharge to f acility classify within standard industrial industry group that be rock crush gravel wash log sorting or log storage facility operate in connection with silvicultural activity and industry group through fed reg pt subpt b it should be note by way of explanation that a industry group be a

supra major group it be fair to say the purpose of the amend regulation be to bring within the npdes permit process only those log operation that involve the four type of activity rock crush gravel wash log sorting and log storage facility that be define as point source by the explicit term of the silvicultural rule up to this stage in the litigation of course the case have be concern with the industrial stormwater rule before the amendment adopt on november the amend regulation will determine whether from this point forward npdes permit will be require for the stormwater discharge at issue the party disagree about the significance of the amend rule for purpose of these case before reach this and other preliminary point however it be appropriate to set forth the fact and history of the case lead to the proceedings in this court b at issue be discharge of channel stormwater runoff from two log road in oregon tillamook state forest lie in the pacific coast range about mile west of portland petitioner west along with other log and company have a contract with the state of oregon to harvest timber from the forest it use the road for that purpose when it rain which it do often in the mountain of northwest oregon average in some area more than inch per year water run off the grade road into a system of ditch culvert and channel that discharge the water into nearby river and stream the discharge often contain large amount of sediment in the form of dirt and crushed gravel from the road there be evidence that this runoff can harm fish and other aquatic organism in september respondent northwest environmental defense center nedc file suit in the united states district court for the district of oregon it invoke the clean water act provision and name as defendant certain firm involve in and operation include petitioner west as well as state and local government and official include the state forester of oregon who be now petitioner doug decker the suit allege that the defendant cause discharge of channel stormwater runoff into two waterway the south fork trask river and the little south fork kilchis river the defendant have not obtain npdes permit and so the suit allege they have violate the act the district court dismiss the action for failure to state a claim it conclude that npdes permit be not require because the ditch culvert and channel be not point source of pollution under the act and the silvicultural rule the court of appeals for the ninth circuit reverse northwest environmental defense center brown it rely upon three principal proposition first it hold that the district court have jurisdiction under notwithstanding a different provision of the act b limit judicial review of epa regulation second the court of appeals hold that while the epa silvicultural rule be ambiguous on the question whether the conveyance at issue be point source those conveyance must be deem point source under the rule in order to give effect to the act expansive definition of the term third the court of appeals hold that because the industrial stormwater rule make to standard industrial classification the discharge at issue be associate with industrial activity within the meaning of the regulation despite the epa conclusion to the contrary the regulation be hold to be unambiguous on this point the court of appeals thus rule that the discharge be from point source and not exempt from the npdes permit scheme by the industrial stormwater rule it follow that petitioner have be in violation of the act this court grant certiorari ii before proceed to the merit it be necessary to consider two jurisdictional question a respondent nedc invoke the jurisdiction of the district court under a which authorize s private enforcement of the provision of the clean water act and its implement regulation department of energy ohio petitioner however maintain that this suit be bar by a separate provision of the act b that statute provide for judicial review in the united states court of appeal of various particular action by the epa administrator include establishment of effluent standard and issuance of permit for discharge of pollutant middlesex county sewerage authority national sea clammers where that review be available it be the exclusive means of challenging action cover by the statute b and a application for review must be lodge in the court of appeal within day of the administrator action b the court of appeals be correct to rule that the exclusive jurisdiction mandate be not applicable in this suit section b extend only to certain suit challenge some agency action it do not bar a district court from entertain a citizen suit under when the suit be against a alleged violator and seek to enforce a obligation impose by the act or its regulation the present action be within the scope of it be a claim to enforce what be at least a permissible reading of the silvicultural rule the rule be ambiguous its characterization of silvicultural harvesting operation from which there be natural runoff cfr b as a nonpoint source might be read as petitioner contend to apply to the channel stormwater runoff at issue or it might be read as respondent nedc urge to apply only to runoff not collect in channel or other engineer improvement see new oxford american dictionary ed oxford dict natural means exist in or cause by nature not make or cause by humankind nedc reading would make the channel discharge here pollution under the act in its view only this interpretation can be square with the act broad definition of point source on this premise the instant suit be a effort not to challenge the silvicultural rule but to enforce it under a proper interpretation it be a basic tenet that regulation in order to be valid must be consistent with the statute under which they be promulgate united states larionoff for jurisdictional purpose it be unnecessary to determine whether nedc be correct in argue that only its reading of the silvicultural rule be permit under the act it suffice to note that nedc urge the court to adopt a purposeful but permissible reading of the regulation to bring it into harmony with the statute environmental defense duke energy nedc do not seek a implicit declaration that the regulation be invalid as write ibid and as a result b be not a jurisdictional bar to this suit b it be a basic principle of article iii that a justiciable case or controversy must remain extant at all stage of review not merely at the time the complaint be file united states juvenile male per curiam slip at internal quotation mark omit this principle require we to determine whether the epa recent amendment to the industrial stormwater rule make the case moot in a supplemental brief file after oral argument petitioner decker join by the united states as amicus curia take the position that the recent amendment make these case moot in relevant part see supp brief for petitioner in supp brief for united states as amicus curiae that conclusion be incorrect a case become moot only when it be impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevail party knox service employees int l slip at internal quotation mark omit here despite the recent amendment a live controversy continue to exist regard whether petitioner may be hold liable for unlawful discharge under the earlier version of the industrial stormwater rule respondent nedc continue to press its claim that petitioner discharge be unlawful under both the amend regulation and the earlier version see supp brief for respondent the instant case provide no occasion to interpret the amend regulation w e be a court of review not of first view arkansas game and fish comm united states ante at quote cutter wilkinson the party however have litigate the suit extensively base on the earlier version of the industrial stormwater rule and that version govern petitioner past discharge which might be the basis for the imposition of penalty even if in the future those type of discharge will not require a permit if the court of appeals be correct that petitioner be obligate to secure npdes permit before discharge channel stormwater runoff the district court might order some remedy for they past violation the act contemplate civil penalty of up to per day d as well as attorney fee for prevail party d nedc in addition request injunctive relief for both past and ongoing violation in part in the form of a order that petitioner incur certain cost to alleviate harm attributable to they past discharge under these circumstance the case remain live and justiciable for the possibility of some remedy for a proven past violation be real and not remote see gwaltney of smithfield chesapeake bay foundation the district court it be true might rule that nedc argument lack merit or that the relief it seek be not warrant on the fact of these case that possibility however do not make the case moot there may be jurisdiction and yet a absence of merit general investment new york central iii the substantive question of the necessity for a npdes permit under the earlier rule now must be address under the act petitioner be require to secure npdes permit for the discharge of channel stormwater runoff only if the discharge be associate with industrial activity p b as that statutory term be define in the preamendment version of the industrial stormwater rule cfr b otherwise the discharge fall within the act general exemption of discharge compose entirely of stormwater from the npdes permit scheme p nedc first contend that the statutory term associate with industrial activity unambiguously cover discharge of channel stormwater runoff from log road see chevron natural resources defense council that view however overlook the multiple definition of the term industrial and industry these word can refer to business activity in general yet so too can they be limit to economic activity concern with the processing of raw material and manufacture of goods in factory oxford dict the latter definition do not necessarily encompass outdoor timber harvesting the statute do not foreclose more specific definition by the agency since it provide no further detail as to its intended scope somewhat more plausible be nedc claim that the preamendment version of the industrial stormwater rule unambiguously require a permit for the discharge at issue nedc reason that under the rule f or the category of industry identify in this section npdes permit be require for among other thing storm water discharge from immediate access road use or travel by carrier of raw material cfr b yet this raise the question whether log be a categor y of industr y identify by the section the regulation go on to identify a list of category of facility that be consider to be engage in industrial activity for purpose of the industrial stormwater rule ibid in the earlier version of the regulation this list include f acility classify as standard industrial classificatio n which encompass logging ibid see also supra at hence nedc assert log be among the category of industry for which storm water discharge from immediate access road use or travel by carrier of raw material require npdes permit under the earlier version of the industrial stormwater rule b nedc further note in support of its reading of the regulation that modern log be a highly mechanized enterprise use sophisticated harvest machine weigh up to ton see brief for respondent the epa take a different view it conclude that the earlier regulation invoke standard industrial classification to regulate traditional industrial source such as sawmill brief for united states as amicus curiae it point to the regulation reference to facility and the classification reference to establishment which suggest industrial site more fixed and permanent than outdoor operation ibid see also fed reg this reading be reinforce by the industrial stormwater rule definition of discharge associate with industrial activity as discharge from any conveyance that be use for collect and convey storm water and that be directly relate to manufacturing processing or raw material storage area at a industrial plant cfr b this language lend support to the epa claim that the regulation do not cover temporary outdoor log installation it be reasonable for the agency to conclude that the conveyance at issue be directly related only to the harvesting of raw material rather than to manufacturing processing or raw material storage area see oxford dict manufacturing be mak ing something on a large scale use machinery at processing be perform ing a series of mechanical or chemical operation on something in order to change or preserve it in addition even if log as a general matter be a type of economic activity within the regulation scope a reasonable interpretation of the regulation could still require the discharge to be relate in a direct way to operation at a industrial plant in order to be subject to npdes permit nedc resist this conclusion note that elsewhere in the industrial stormwater rule the epa have require npdes permit for stormwater discharge associate with other type of outdoor economic activity see b iii mining b v landfill receive industrial waste b x large construction site the epa reasonably could conclude however that these type of activity tend to be more fixed and permanent than operation be and have a closer connection to traditional industrial site in light of the language of the regulation just discuss moreover the inclusion of these type of economic activity in the industrial stormwater rule need not be read to mandate that all stormwater discharge relate to these activity fall within the rule just as the inclusion of log need not be read to extend to all discharge from log site the regulation reach may be limit by the requirement that the discharge be directly relate to manufacturing processing or raw material storage area at a industrial plant b it be well establish that a agency interpretation need not be the only possible reading of a regulation or even the best one to prevail when a agency interpret its own regulation the court as a general rule defer to it unless that interpretation be plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation chase bank usa mccoy slip at quote auer at the epa interpretation be a permissible one take together the regulation reference to facility establishment manufacturing processing and a industrial plant leave open the rational interpretation that the regulation extend only to traditional industrial building such as factory and associate site as well as other relatively fix facility there be another reason to accord auer deference to the epa interpretation there be no indication that its current view be a change from prior practice or a post hoc justification adopt in response to litigation see christopher smithkline beecham slip at the opposite be the case the agency have be consistent in its view that the type of discharge at issue here do not require npdes permit the epa decision exist against a background of state regulation with respect to stormwater runoff from log road the state of oregon have make a extensive effort to develop a comprehensive set of best practice to manage stormwater runoff from log road these practice include rule mandate filtration of stormwater runoff before it enter river and stream admin rule require log company to construct road use surface that minimize the sediment in runoff rule and obligate firm to cease operation where such effort fail to prevent visible increase in water turbidity rule oregon have invest substantial time and money in establish these practice in addition the development siting maintenance and regulation of road and in particular of state forest road be area in which oregon have considerable expertise in exercise the broad discretion the clean water act give the epa in the realm of stormwater runoff the agency could reasonably have conclude that further federal regulation in this area would be duplicative or counterproductive indeed congress have give express instruction to the epa to work in consultation with state and local official to alleviate stormwater pollution by develop the precise kind of best management practice oregon have establish here p the preamendment version of the industrial stormwater rule as permissibly construe by the agency exempt discharge of channel stormwater runoff from log road from the npdes permit scheme as a result there be no need to reach petitioner alternative argument that the conveyance in question be not pipe s ditch e channel s tunnel s conduit s or any other type of point source within the act definition of the term for the reason state the judgment of the court of appeals be reverse and the case be remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion it be so order justice breyer

chief justice roberts with whom justice alito join concur the opinion concurring in part and dissent in part raise serious question about the principle set forth in bowles seminole rock sand and auer

one go to the heart of administrative law question of seminole rock and auer deference arise as a matter of course on a regular basis the bar be now aware that there be some interest in reconsider those case and have available to it a concise statement of the argument on one side of the issue i would await a case in which the issue be properly raise and argue the present case should be decide

justice scalia concur in part and dissent in part i join part i and ii of the court opinion i agree that these case be not moot and that the district court have jurisdiction i do not join part iii the court there give effect to a reading of epa regulation that be not the most natural one simply because epa say that it believe the unnatural reading be right it do this moreover even though the agency have vividly illustrate that it can write a rule say precisely what it mean by do just that while these case be be brief enough be enough i for decade and for no good reason we have be give agency the authority to say what they rule mean under the banner of defer ring to a agency interpretation of its own regulation talk america michigan bell telephone scalia concur slip at this be generally call seminole rock or auer deference see bowles seminole rock sand auer robbins two term ago in my separate concurrence in talk america i express doubt about the validity of this practice in that case however the agency interpretation of the rule be also the fairest one and no party have ask we to reconsider auer today however the court deference to the agency make the difference note the court defensive insistence that the agency interpretation need not be the best one ante at and respondent have ask we if necessary to reconsider auer i believe that it be time to do so see brief for respondent see also brief for law professors on the propriety of administrative deference as amici curiae this be especially true because the circumstance of these case illustrate auer flaw in a particularly vivid way the canonical formulation of auer deference be that we will enforce a agency interpretation of its own rule unless that interpretation be plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation seminole rock supra at but of course whenever the agency interpretation of the regulation be different from the fairest reading it be in that sense inconsistent with the regulation obviously that be not enough or there would be nothing for auer to do in practice auer deference be chevron deference apply to regulation rather than statute see chevron natural resources defense council the agency interpretation will be accept if though not the fairest reading of the regulation it be a plausible reading within the scope of the ambiguity that the regulation contain we case have not put forward a persuasive justification for auer deference the first case to apply it seminole rock offer no justification whatever just the ipse dixit that the administrative interpretation become of control weight unless it be plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation at we later case provide two principal explanation neither of which have much to be say for it see generally stephenson pogoriler seminole rock domain geo first some case say that the agency as the drafter of the rule will have some special insight into its intent when enact it martin occupational safety and health review comm n the imply premise of this argument that what we be look for be the agency intent in adopt the rule be false there be true of regulation what be true of statute as justice holmes put it w e do not inquire what the legislature mean we ask only what the statute mean the theory of legal interpretation harv whether govern rule be make by the national legislature or a administrative agency we be bind by what they say not by the unexpressed intention of those who make they the other rationale we case provide be that the agency possess special expertise in administer its complex and highly technical regulatory program see thomas jefferson shalala that be true enough and it lead to the conclusion that agency and not court should make regulation but it have nothing to do with who should interpret regulation unless one believe that the purpose of interpretation be to make the regulatory program work in a fashion that the current leadership of the agency deem effective make regulatory program effective be the purpose of rulemaking in which the agency use its special expertise to formulate the best rule but the purpose of interpretation be to determine the fair meaning of the rule to say what the law be marbury madison cranch not to make policy but to determine what policy have be make and promulgate by the agency to which the public owe obedience indeed since the leadership of agency and hence the policy preference of agency change with presidential administration a agency head can only be sure that the application of he special expertise to the issue address by a regulation will be give effect if we adhere to predictable principle of textual interpretation rather than defer to the special expertise of he successor if we take agency enactment as write the executive have a stable background against which to write its rule and achieve the policy end it think best another conceivable justification for auer deference though not one that be to be find in we case be this if it be reasonable to defer to agency regard the meaning of statute that congress enact as we do per chevron it be a fortiori reasonable to defer to they regard the meaning of regulation that they themselves craft to give a agency less control over the meaning of its own regulation than it have over the meaning of a congressionally enact statute seem quite odd but it be not odd at all the theory of chevron take it or leave it be that when congress give a agency authority to administer a statute include authority to issue interpretive regulation it implicitly accord the agency a degree of discretion which the court must respect regard the meaning of the statute see smiley citibank south dakota while the implication of a agency power to clarify the statute be reasonable enough there be surely no congressional implication that the agency can resolve ambiguity in its own regulation for that would violate a fundamental principle of separation of power that the power to write a law and the power to interpret it can not rest in the same hand when the legislative and executive power be unite in the same person there can be no liberty because apprehension may arise lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical law to execute they in a tyrannical manner montesquieu spirit of the laws bk xi ch piest nugent transl congress can not enlarge its own power through chevron whatever it leave vague in the statute will be work out by someone else chevron represent a presumption about who as between the executive and the judiciary that someone else will be the executive by the way the compete political branch be the less congenial repository of the power as far as congress be concern so congress incentive be to speak as clearly as possible on the matter it regard as important but when a agency interpret its own rule that be something else then the power to prescribe be augment by the power to interpret and the incentive be to speak vaguely and broadly so as to retain a flexibility that will enable clarification with retroactive effect it be perfectly understandable for a agency to issue vague regulation if do so will maximiz e agency power thomas jefferson supra at thomas dissent combine the power to prescribe with the power to interpret be not a new evil blackstone condemn the practice of resolve doubt about the construction of the roman law by stat ing the case to the emperor in write and tak ing he opinion upon it blackstone commentary on the law of england and we constitution do not mirror the british practice of use the house of lords as a court of last resort due in part to the fear that he who have agency in pass bad law might operate in the same spirit in they interpretation the federalist cooke ed auer deference encourage agency to be vague in frame regulation with the plan of issue interpretation to create the intended new law without observance of notice and comment procedure anthony the supreme court and the apa sometimes they just do not get it admin am auer be not a logical corollary to chevron but a dangerous permission slip for the arrogation of power see talk america at scalia concur slip at manning constitutional structure and judicial deference to agency interpretations of agency rules colum it be true enough that auer deference have the same beneficial pragmatic effect as chevron deference the country need not endure the uncertainty produce by divergent view of numerous district court and court of appeal as to what be the fairest reading of the regulation until a definitive answer be finally provide year later by this court the agency view can be rely upon unless it be so to speak beyond the pale but the duration of the uncertainty produce by a vague regulation need not be as long as the uncertainty produce by a vague statute for as soon as a interpretation uncongenial to the agency be pronounce by a district court the agency can begin the process of amend the regulation to make its meaning entirely clear the circumstance of this case demonstrate the point while these case be be brief before we epa issue a rule design to respond to the court of appeals judgment we be review see fed reg to be codify in cfr pt sub pt b it do so by the standard of such thing relatively quickly the decision below be hand
