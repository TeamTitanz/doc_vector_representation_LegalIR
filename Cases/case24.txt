raise by a handler in the context of a enforcement proceeding initiate by the usda under the provision text do not bar handler from raise constitutional defens to the usda enforcement action allow handler to do so would not diminish the incentive to file direct challenge to marketing order under a for a handler who refuse to comply with a marketing order and wait for a enforcement action will be liable for significant monetary penalty if the constitutional challenge fail it would also make little sense to force a party to pay a assess fine in one proceeding and then turn around and sue for
