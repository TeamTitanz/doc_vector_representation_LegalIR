act handbook domike zacaroli ed see generally cfr pt states have primary responsibility for implement the naaqs by develop state implementation plan a state must designate every area within its border

the area where the source be or be propose to be located a c i stationary source in area designate attainment or unclassifiable be subject to the act provision relate to prevention of significant

specific pollutant since the inception of the psd program every area of the country have be designate attainment or unclassifiable for at least one naaqs pollutant thus on epa view all stationary source be potentially subject to psd review it be unlawful to construct or modify a major emit facility in any area to which the psd program apply without first obtain a permit a c to qualify for a permit the facility must not cause or contribute to the violation of any applicable standard a and it must comply with emission limitation that reflect the best available control technology or bact

certain type of source it define modification as a physical or operational change that cause the facility to emit more of any air pollutant a in addition to the psd permit requirement for construction and modification title v of the act make it unlawful to operate any major source wherever located without a comprehensive operating permit a unlike the psd program title v generally do not impose any substantive requirement instead it be design to facilitate compliance and enforcement by consolidate into a single document all of a facility obligation under the act the permit must include all emission limitation and standard that apply to the source as well as associated inspection monitoring and reporting requirement a c title v define a major source by reference to the definition of major stationary source which in turn mean any stationary source with the potential to emit ton per year of any air pollutant b j epa regulations in the court hold that title ii of the act authorize d epa to regulate greenhouse gas emission from new motor vehicle if the agency form ed a judgment that such emission contribute to climate change massachusetts epa quote a in response to that decision epa embark on a course of regulation result in the single largest expansion in the scope of the act in its history clean air act handbook at xxi epa first ask the public in a notice of propose rulemaking to comment on how the agency should respond to massachusetts in do so it explain that regulate emission from motor vehicle could have consequence for stationary source under epa view once greenhouse gas become regulate under any part of the act the psd and title v permit requirement would apply to all stationary source with the potential to emit greenhouse gas in excess of the statutory threshold ton per year under title v and or ton per year under the psd program depend on the type of source fed reg because emission tend to be order of magnitude greater than emission of conventional pollutant epa project that numerous small source not previously regulate under the act would be sweep into the psd program and title v include smaller industrial source large office and residential building hotel large retail establishment and similar facility at the agency warn that this would constitute a unprecedented expansion of epa authority that would have a profound effect on virtually every sector of the economy and touch every household in the land yet still be relatively ineffective at reduce greenhouse gas concentration at in epa announce its determination regard the danger pose by emission epa find that emission from new motor vehicle contribute to elevated atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gas which endanger public health and welfare by foster global climate change fed reg hereinafter endangerment finding it denominate a single air pollutant the combine mix of six greenhouse gas that it identify as the root cause of climate change carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide hydrofluorocarbon perfluorocarbon and sulfur hexafluoride at a source emission would be measure in carbon dioxide equivalent unit which would be calculate base on each gas global warming potential at next epa issue its final decision regard the prospect that standard would trigger permit requirement fed reg hereinafter trigger rule epa announce that begin on the effective date of its standard for motor vehicle stationary source would be subject to the psd program and title v on the basis of they potential to emit greenhouse gas as expect epa in short order promulgate emission standard for passenger car truck and passenger vehicle to take effect on january fed reg hereinafter tailpipe rule epa then announce step it be take to tailor the psd program and title v to greenhouse gas fed reg hereinafter tailoring rule those step be necessary it say because the psd program and title v be design to regulate a relatively small number of large industrial source and require permit for all source with emission above the statutory threshold would radically expand those program make they both unadministrable and unrecognizable to the congress that design they at epa nonetheless reject call to exclude greenhouse gas entirely from those program assert that the act be not ambiguous with respect to the need to cover source under either the psd or title v program at instead epa adopt a approach that it say would appl y psd and title v at threshold level that be as close to the statutory level as possible and do so as quickly as possible at least to a certain point at the epa say would consist of at least three step during step from january through june no source would become newly subject to the psd program or title v solely on the basis of its emission however source require to obtain permit anyway because of they emission of conventional pollutant anyway source would need to comply with bact for greenhouse gas if they emit those gas in significant amount define as at least ton per year ibid during step from july through june source with the potential to emit at least ton per year of greenhouse gas would be subject to psd and title v permit for they construction and operation and to psd permit for modification that would increase they emission by at least ton per year at at step begin on july epa say it might or might not further reduce the permit threshold though not below ton per year and it might or might not establish permanent exemption for some source at beyond step epa promise to complete another round of rulemaking by april in which it would take further action to address small source which might or might not include establish permanent exemption at epa codify step and at cfr b and b for psd and at and for title v and it codify its commitment regard step and beyond at and see tailoring rule after the decision below epa issue its final step rule in which it decide not to lower the threshold it have establish at step until at least fed reg decision below numerous party include several states file petition for review in the circuit under b challenging epa action the court of appeals dismiss some of the petition for lack of jurisdiction and deny the remainder coalition for responsible regulation epa per curiam first it uphold the endangerment finding and tailpipe rule at next it hold that epa interpretation of the psd permit requirement as apply to any regulated air pollutant include greenhouse gas be compel by the statute at the court also find it crystal clear that psd permittee must install bact for greenhouse gas at because it deem petitioner argument about the psd program insufficiently applicable to title v it hold they have forfeit any challenge to epa greenhouse interpretation of title at finally it hold that petitioner be without article iii stand to challenge epa effort to limit the reach of the psd program and title v through the triggering and tailoring rule at the court deny rehearing en banc with judges brown and kavanaugh each dissent app wl we grant six petition for certiorari but agree to decide only one question whether epa permissibly determine that its regulation of greenhouse gas emission from new motor vehicle trigger permit requirement under the clean air act for stationary source that emit greenhouse gas ii analysis this litigation present two distinct challenge to epa stance on permit for stationary source first we must decide whether epa permissibly determine that a source may be subject to the psd and title v permit requirement on the sole basis of the source potential to emit greenhouse gas second we must decide whether epa permissibly determine that a source already subject to the psd program because of its emission of conventional pollutant a anyway source may be require to limit its emission by employ the best available control technology for greenhouse gas the solicitor general join issue on both point but evidently regard the second as more important he inform we that anyway source account for roughly of american emission compare to just for the additional non anyway source epa seek to regulate at step and of the tailor rule tr of oral arg we review epa interpretation of the clean air act use the standard set forth in chevron natural resources defense council under chevron we presume that when a statute be ambiguous with respect to what it prescribe congress have empower the agency to resolve the ambiguity the question for a review court be whether in do so the agency have act reasonably and thus have stay within the bound of its statutory authority arlington fcc slip at emphasis delete a the psd and title v trigger we first decide whether epa permissibly interpret the statute to provide that a source may be require to obtain a psd or title v permit on the sole basis of its potential emission epa think its conclusion that a source emission may necessitate a psd or title v permit follow from the act unambiguous language the court of appeals agree and hold that the statute compel epa interpretation at we disagree the statute compel epa interpretation with respect to neither the psd program nor title the court of appeals reason by way of a flawed syllogism under massachusetts the general definition of air pollutant include greenhouse gas the act require permit for major emitter of any air pollutant therefore the act require permit for major emitter of greenhouse gas the conclusion follow from the premise only if the air pollutant refer to in the provision the minor premise be the same air pollutant encompass by the definition as interpret in massachusetts the major premise yet no one least of all epa endorse that proposition and it be obviously untenable the definition say that a air pollutant be any air pollution agent or combination of such agent include any physical chemical biological or radioactive substance or matter which be emit into or otherwise enter the ambient air g in massachusetts the court hold that the definition include greenhouse gas because it be it embrace all airborne compound of whatever stripe at but where the term air pollutant appear in the act operative provision epa have routinely give it a narrower meaning that be certainly true of the provision that require psd and title v permit for major emitter of any air pollutant since epa regulation have interpret air pollutant in the psd permit trigger as limit to regulate air pollutant fed reg codify as amend cfr b a class much narrower than massachusetts all airborne compound of whatever stripe at and since epa have informally take the same position with regard to the title v permit trigger a position the agency ultimately incorporate into some of the regulation at issue here see memorandum from lydia wegman deputy director office of air quality planning and standards to air division director regions tailor rule amend cfr those interpretation be appropriate it be plain as day that the act do not envision a elaborate burdensome permit process for major emitter of steam oxygen or other harmless airborne substance it take some cheek for epa to insist that it can not possibly give air pollutant a reasonable meaning in the psd and title v context when it have be do precisely that for decade nor be those the only place in the act where epa have infer from statutory context that a generic reference to air pollutant do not encompass every substance fall within the definition other example abound the act authorize epa to enforce new source performance standard nsp against a source if after promulgation of the standard the source undergo a physical or operational change that increase its emission of any air pollutant a b b epa interpret that provision as limit to air pollutant for which epa have promulgate new source performance standard fed reg codify as amend cfr fed reg codify as amend cfr a the act require a permit for the construction or operation in a nonattainment area of a source with the potential to emit ton per year of any air pollutant c j epa interpret that provision as limit to pollutant for which the area be designate nonattainment fed reg promulgate cfr j as amend a the act direct epa to require enhance monitoring and submission of compliance certification for any source with the potential to emit ton per year of any air pollutant a j epa interpret that provision as limit to regulate pollutant fed reg codify at cfr the act require certain source of air pollutant that interfere with visibility to undergo retrofitting if they have the potential to emit ton per year of any pollutant b a g epa interpret that provision as limit to air pollutant fed reg codify at cfr pt app y although these limitation be nowhere to be find in the definition in each instance epa have conclude as it have in the psd and title v context that the statute be not use air pollutant in massachusetts broad sense to mean any airborne substance whatsoever massachusetts do not invalidate all these longstanding construction that case do not hold that epa must always regulate greenhouse gas as a air pollutant everywhere that term appear in the statute but only that epa must ground its reason for action or inaction in the statute at emphasis add rather than on reasoning divorce from the statutory text at epa inaction with regard to title ii be not sufficiently ground in the statute the court say in part because nothing in the act suggest that regulate greenhouse gas under that title would conflict with the statutory design title ii would not compel epa to regulate in any way that would be extreme counterintuitive or contrary to common sense at at most it would require epa to take the modest step of add standard to the roster of emission regulation ibid massachusetts do not strip epa of authority to exclude greenhouse gas from the class of regulable air pollutant under other part of the act where they inclusion would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme the definition to which the court give a sweep and capacious interpretation at be not a command to regulate but a description of the universe of substance epa may consider regulate under the act operative provision massachusetts do not foreclose the agency use of statutory context to infer that certain of the act provision use air pollutant to denote not every conceivable airborne substance but only those that may sensibly be encompass within the particular regulatory program as certain amicus felicitously put it while massachusetts reject epa categorical contention that greenhouse gas could not be air pollutant for any purpose of the act it do not embrace epa current equally categorical position that greenhouse gas must be air pollutant for all purpose regardless of the statutory context brief for administrative law professors et as amici curiae to be sure congress profligate use of air pollutant where what be mean be obviously narrower than the definition be not conducive to clarity one ordinarily assume that identical word use in different part of the same act be intend to have the same meaning environmental defense duke energy in this respect as in countless other the act be far from a chef of legislative draftsmanship but we and epa must do we best bear in mind the fundamental canon of statutory construction that the word of a statute must be read in they context and with a view to they place in the overall statutory scheme fda brown williamson tobacco as we reiterate the same day we decide massachusetts the presumption of consistent usage readily yield to context and a statutory term even one define in the statute may take on distinct character from association with distinct statutory object call for different implementation strategy duke energy supra at we need not and do not pass on the validity of all the limit construction epa have give the term air pollutant throughout the act we merely observe that take together they belie epa rigid insistence that when interpret the psd and title v permit requirement it be bind by the definition inclusion of greenhouse gas no matter how incompatible that inclusion be with those program regulatory structure in sum there be no insuperable textual barrier to epa interpret any air pollutant in the permit trigger of psd and title v to encompass only pollutant emit in quantity that enable they to be sensibly regulate at the statutory threshold and to exclude those atypical pollutant that like greenhouse gas be emit in such vast quantity that they inclusion would radically transform those program and render they unworkable as write have determine that epa be mistake in think the act compel a interpretation of the psd and title v trigger we next consider the agency alternative position that its interpretation be justified as a exercise of its discretion to adopt a reasonable construction of the statute tailor rule we conclude that epa interpretation be not permissible even under chevron deferential framework agency must operate within the bound of reasonable interpretation arlington at slip at and reasonable statutory interpretation must account for both the specific context in which language be use and the broader context of the statute as a whole robinson shell oil a statutory provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation be often clarify by the remainder of the statutory scheme because only one of the permissible meaning produce a substantive effect that be compatible with the rest of the law united sav of timbers of inwood forest associates thus a agency interpretation that be inconsisten t with the design and structure of the statute as a whole university of southwestern medical center nassar slip at do not merit deference epa itself have repeatedly acknowledge that apply the psd and title v permit requirement to greenhouse gas would be inconsistent with in fact would overthrow the act structure and design in the tailoring rule epa describe the calamitous consequence of interpret the act in that way under the psd program annual permit application would jump from about to nearly annual administrative cost would swell from million to over billion and delay in issue permit would become common cause construction project to grind to a halt nationwide tailor rule the picture under title v be equally bleak the number of source require to have permit would jump from fewer than to about million annual administrative cost would balloon from million to billion and collectively the newly cover source would face permit cost of billion at moreover the great majority of additional source bring into the psd and title v program would be small source that congress do not expect would need to undergo permit at epa state that these result would be so contrary to congressional intent and would so severely undermine what congress seek to accomplish that they necessitate as much as a increase in the permit threshold set forth in the statute at like epa we think it beyond reasonable debate that require permit for source base solely on they emission of greenhouse gas at the and level set forth in the statute would be incompatible with the substance of congress regulatory scheme brown williamson at a brief review of the relevant statutory provision leave no doubt that the psd program and title v be design to apply to and can not rationally be extend beyond a relative handful of large source capable of shoulder heavy substantive and procedural burden start with the psd program which impose numerous and costly requirement on those source that be require to apply for permit among other thing the applicant must make available a detailed scientific analysis of the source potential impact demonstrate that the source will not contribute to the violation of any applicable pollution standard and identify and use the best available control technology for each regulate pollutant it emit a e the permit authority the state usually also bear its share of the burden it must grant or deny a permit within a year during which time it must hold a public hearing on the application a c not surprisingly epa acknowledge that psd review be a complicate and sometimes contentious process suitable for hundred of larger source not ten of thousand of smaller source fed reg title v contain no comparable substantive requirement but impose elaborate procedural mandate it require the applicant to submit within a year of become subject to title v a permit application and a compliance plan describe how it will comply with all applicable requirement under the act to certify its compliance annually and to submit to inspection entry monitoring and report requirement b c a c the procedural burden on the permit authority and epa be also significant the permit authority must hold a public hearing on the application b and it must forward the application and any propose permit to epa and neighbor states and respond in write to they comment a b if it fail to issue or deny the permit within month any interested party can sue to require a decision without additional delay b c a interested party also can petition epa to block issuance of the permit epa must grant or deny the petition within day and its decision may be challenge in federal court b as epa write title v be finely craft for thousand not million of source tailor rule the fact that epa interpretation of the psd and title v trigger would place plainly excessive demand on limited governmental resource be alone a good reason for reject it but that be not the only reason epa interpretation be also unreasonable because it would bring about a enormous and transformative expansion in epa regulatory authority without clear congressional authorization when a agency claim to discover in a statute a unheralded power to regulate a significant portion of the american economy brown williamson at we typically greet its announcement with a measure of skepticism we expect congress to speak clearly if it wish to assign to a agency decision of vast economic and political significance at see also mci telecommunications american telephone telegraph industrial union american petroleum institute plurality opinion the power to require permit for the construction and modification of ten of thousand and the operation of million of small source nationwide fall comfortably within the class of authorization that we have be reluctant to read into ambiguous statutory text moreover in epa assertion of that authority we confront a singular situation a agency lay claim to extravagant statutory power over the national economy while at the same time strenuously assert that the authority claim would render the statute unrecognizable to the congress that design it tailor rule since as we hold above the statute do not compel epa interpretation it would be patently unreasonable not to say outrageous for epa to insist on seize expansive power that it admit the statute be not design to grant epa think that despite the foregoing problem it could make its interpretation reasonable by adjust the level at which a source emission would oblige it to undergo psd and title v permit although the act in no uncertain term require permit for source with the potential to emit more than or ton per year of a relevant pollutant epa in its tailoring rule write a new threshold of ton per year for greenhouse gas since the court of appeals think the statute unambiguously make greenhouse gas capable of trigger psd and title v it hold that petitioner lack article iii stand to challenge the tailoring rule because that rule do not injure petitioner but merely relax the statutory requirement because we however hold that epa interpretation of the trigger be not compel and because epa have essentially admit that its interpretation would be unreasonable without tailor we consider the validity of the tailor rule we conclude that epa rewrite of the statutory threshold be impermissible and therefore could not validate the agency interpretation of the triggering provision a agency have no power to tailor legislation to bureaucratic policy goal by rewrite unambiguous statutory term agencies exercise discretion only in the interstice create by statutory silence or ambiguity they must always give effect to the unambiguously express intent of congress national of home builders defender of wildlife quote chevron at it be hard to imagine a statutory term less ambiguous than the precise numerical threshold at which the act require psd and title v permit when epa replace those number with other of its own choosing it go well beyond the bound of its statutory authority arlington at slip at emphasis delete the solicitor general do not and can not defend the tailor rule as a exercise of epa enforcement discretion the tailor rule be not just a announcement of epa refusal to enforce the statutory permit requirement it purport to alter those requirement and to establish with the force of law that conduct will not violate the act this alteration of the statutory requirement be crucial to epa tailor effort without it small entity with the potential to emit greenhouse gas in amount exceed the statutory threshold would have remain subject to citizen suit authorize by the act to enjoin they construction modification or operation and to impose civil penalty of up to per day of violation b a f cfr epa itself have recently affirm that the independent enforcement authority furnish by the provision can not be displace by a permit authority decision not to pursue enforcement fed reg the solicitor general be therefore quite right to acknowledge that the availability of citizen suit make it necessary for epa in seek to mitigate the unreasonableness of its interpretation to go beyond merely exercise its enforcement discretion see tr of oral arg for similar reason morton ruiz to which the solicitor general point as the best case support the tailor rule see tr of oral arg be irrelevant in ruiz congress have appropriate fund for the bureau of indian affairs to spend on provide assistance to indians throughout the united states and have not impose d any geographical limitation on the availability of general assistance benefit at and although we hold the bureau could not deny benefit to indians because it have not publish its eligibility criterion we state in dictum that the bureau could if it follow proper administrative procedure create reasonable classification and eligibility requirement in order to allocate the limited fund available at that dictum stand only for the unremarkable proposition that a agency may adopt policy to prioritize its expenditure within the bound establish by congress see also lincoln vigil nothing in ruiz remotely authorize a agency to modify unambiguous requirement impose by a federal statute a agency confront resource constraint may change its own conduct but it can not change the law be we to recognize the authority claim by epa in the tailoring rule we would deal a severe blow to the constitution separation of power under we system of government congress make law and the president act at time through agency like epa faithfully execute s they art ii see medellín texas the power of execute the law necessarily include both authority and responsibility to resolve some question leave open by congress that arise during the law administration but it do not include a power to revise clear statutory term that turn out not to work in practice see barnhart sigmon coal agency lack authority to develop new guideline or to assign liability in a manner inconsistent with a unambiguous statute in the tailoring rule epa assert newfound authority to regulate million of small source include retail store office apartment building shopping center school and church and to decide on a ongoing basis and without regard for the threshold prescribe by congress how many of those source to regulate we be not willing to stand on the dock and wave goodbye as epa embark on this multiyear voyage of discovery we reaffirm the core principle that a agency may not rewrite clear statutory term to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate epa therefore lack authority to tailor the act unambiguous numerical threshold to accommodate its interpretation of the permit trigger instead the need to rewrite clear provision of the statute should have alert epa that it have take a wrong interpretive turn agencies be not free to adopt unreasonable interpretation of statutory provision and then edit other statutory provision to mitigate the unreasonableness app wl kavanaugh dissent from denial of rehearing en banc because the tailor rule can not save epa interpretation of the trigger that interpretation be impermissible under chevron bact for anyway source for the reason we have give epa overstep its statutory authority when it decide that a source could become subject to psd or title v permit by reason of its emission but what about anyway source those that would need permit base on they emission of more conventional pollutant such as particulate matter we now consider whether epa reasonably interpret the act to require those source to comply with best available control technology emission standard for greenhouse gas to obtain a psd permit a source must be subject to the best available control technology for each pollutant subject to regulation under the act that it emit a the act define bact as a emission limitation base on the maximum degree of reduction of each pollutant subject to regulation that be achievable through application of production process and available method system and technique include fuel cleaning clean fuel or treatment or innovative fuel combustion technique bact be determine on a basis take into account energy environmental and economic impact and other cost ibid some petitioner urge we to hold that epa may never require bact for greenhouse gas even when a source must undergo psd review base on its emission of conventional pollutant because bact be fundamentally unsuited to regulation bact they say have traditionally be about control such as catalytic converter or particle collector but apply it to greenhouse gas will make it more about regulate energy use which will enable regulator to control every aspect of a facility operation and design right down to the light bulb in the factory cafeteria brief for petitioner manufacturers working group on greenhouse gas regulation et in see joint reply brief for petitioner in bact for greenhouse gas become a unbounded exercise in regulation of everything from efficient light bulb to basic industrial process but see brief for calpine as amicus curiae i n calpine experience with anyway source the analysis be only a small part of the overall permit process epa have publish a guidance document that lend some credence to petitioner fear it state that at least initially compulsory improvement in energy efficiency will be the foundation of bact with more traditional control either not use or add as they become more available psd and title v permitting guidance for greenhouse gas hereinafter guidance see peloso dobbins greenhouse gas psd permitting the year in review env because other control tend to prove infeasible energy efficiency measure dominate the bact control approve by the state and epa but epa guidance also state that bact analysis should consider option other than energy efficiency such as carbon capture and storage guidance epa argue that carbon capture be reasonably comparable to more traditional bact technology at and petitioner do not dispute that moreover assume without decide that bact may be use to force some improvement in energy efficiency there be important limitation on bact that may work to mitigate petitioner concern about unbounded regulatory authority for one bact be base on control technology for the applicant propose facility a therefore it have long be hold that bact can not be use to order a fundamental redesign of the facility see sierra club epa in re pennsauken resource recovery facility eab for another epa have long interpret bact as require only for pollutant that the source itself emit see fed reg accordingly epa acknowledge that bact may not be use to require reduction in a facility demand for energy from the electric grid guidance finally epa guidance suggest that bact should not require every conceivable change that could result in minor improvement in energy efficiency such as the aforementioned light bulb at the guidance explain that permit authority should instead consider whether a propose regulatory burden outweigh any reduction in emission to be achieve and should concentrate on the facility equipment that use the largest amount of energy ibid the question before we be whether epa decision to require bact for greenhouse gas emit by source otherwise subject to psd review be as a general matter a permissible interpretation of the statute under chevron we conclude that it be the text of the bact provision be far less than the text of the psd and title v permit trigger it state that bact be require for each pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter the entire act a a phrase that as the circuit write year ago would not seem readily susceptible of misinterpretation alabama power costle whereas the dubious breadth of any air pollutant in the permit trigger suggest a role for agency judgment in identify the subset of pollutant cover by the particular regulatory program at issue the more specific phrasing of the bact provision suggest that the necessary judgment have already be make by congress the wider statutory context likewise do not suggest that the bact provision can bear a narrowing construction there be no indication that the act elsewhere use or that epa have interpret each pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter to mean anything other than what it say even if the text be not clear apply bact to greenhouse gas be not so disastrously unworkable and need not result in such a dramatic expansion of agency authority as to convince we that epa interpretation be unreasonable we be not talk about extend epa jurisdiction over million of previously unregulated entity but about moderately increase the demand epa or a state permit authority can make of entity already subject to its regulation and it be not yet clear that epa demand will be of a significantly different character from those traditionally associate with psd review in short the record before we do not establish that the bact provision as write be incapable of be sensibly apply to greenhouse gas we acknowledge the potential for bact to lead to a unreasonable and unanticipated degree of regulation and we decision should not be take as a endorsement of all aspect of epa current approach nor as a free rein for any future regulatory application of bact in this distinct context we narrow holding be that nothing in the statute categorically prohibit epa from interpret the bact provision to apply to greenhouse gas emit by anyway source however epa may require a anyway source to comply with bact only if the source emit more than a de minimis amount of greenhouse gas as note above the tailoring rule apply bact only if a source emit greenhouse gas in excess of ton per year but the rule make clear that epa do not arrive at that number by identify the de minimis level see nn supra epa may establish a appropriate de minimis threshold below which bact be not require for a source emission we do not hold that ton per year necessarily exceed a true de minimis level only that epa must justify its selection on proper grounds alabama power supra at to sum up we hold that epa exceed its statutory authority when it interpret the clean air act to require psd and title v permit for stationary source base on they emission specifically the agency may not treat greenhouse gas as a pollutant for purpose of define a major emit facility or a modification thereof in the psd context or a major source in the title v context to the extent its regulation purport to do so they be invalid epa may however continue to treat greenhouse gas as a pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter for purpose of require bact for anyway source the judgment of the court of appeals be affirm in part and reverse in part it be so order opinion of breyer and et et et et et et et et et and et et on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the district of columbia circuit june justice breyer with whom justice ginsburg justice sotomayor and justice kagan join concur in part and dissent in part in massachusetts epa we hold that greenhouse gas fall within the clean air act general definition of the term air pollutant g at we also hold consequently that the environmental protection agency be empower and require by title ii of the act to regulate greenhouse gas emission from mobile source such as car and truck if it decide that greenhouse gas contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipate to endanger public health or welfare a at the epa determine that greenhouse gas endanger human health and welfare fed reg endangerment finding and so it issue regulation for mobile emission fed reg tailpipe rule these case take as a give we decision in massachusetts that the act general definition of air pollutant include greenhouse gas one of the question pose by these case be whether those gas fall within the scope of the phrase any air pollutant as that phrase be use in the more specific provision of the act here at issue the court answer be no ante at i disagree the clean air act provision at issue here be title i prevention of significant deterioration psd program et and title v permit regime et by contrast to title ii titles i and v apply to stationary source such as power plant and factory under the psd program major emit facility construct in the united states must meet certain requirement include obtain a permit that impose emission limitation a and use the best available control technology for each pollutant subject to regulation under the act emit from the facility a title v require each major source to obtain a operating permit a these case concern the definition of major emit facility and major source each of which be define to mean any stationary source that emit more than a threshold quantity of any air pollutant see major emit facility j b major source to simplify the exposition i will refer only to the psd program and its definition of major emit facility a parallel analysis apply to title as it be use in the psd provision t he term major emit facility mean any of a list of specific category of stationary source of air pollutant which emit or have the potential to emit one hundred ton per year or more of any air pollutant such term also include any other source with the potential to emit two hundred and fifty ton per year or more of any air pollutant to simplify further i will ignore the reference to specific type of source that emit at least ton per year tpy of any air pollutant in effect we be deal with a statute that say that the psd program regulatory requirement must be apply to any stationary source that have the potential to emit two hundred fifty ton per year or more of any air pollutant the interpretive difficulty in these case arise out of the definition use of the phrase two hundred fifty ton per year or more which i will call the tpy threshold when apply to greenhouse gas tpy be far too low a threshold as the court explain ten of thousand of stationary source emit large quantity of one greenhouse gas carbon dioxide see ante at and to apply the program at issue here to all those source would be extremely expensive and burdensome counterproductive and perhaps impossible it would also contravene congress intent that the program coverage be limit to those large source whose emission be substantial enough to justify the regulatory burden ibid the epa recognize as much and it address the problem by issue a regulation the tailoring rule that purport to raise the coverage threshold for greenhouse gas from the statutory figure of tpy to tpy in order to keep the program coverage limit to a relatively small number of large industrial source fed reg see at the tailor rule solve the practical problem that would have be cause by the tpy threshold but what be we to do about the statute language the statute specify a definite number not and it say that facility that be cover by that number must meet the program requirement the statute say nothing about agency discretion to change that number what be to be do how give the statute language can the epa exempt from regulation source that emit more than but less than tpy of greenhouse gas and that also do not emit other regulate pollutant at threshold level the court answer by point out that regulation at the tpy threshold would produce absurd result refuse to read the statute as compelling such result and consequently interpret the phrase any air pollutant as contain a implicit exception for greenhouse gas emphasis add put differently the court read the statute as define major emit facility to mean stationary source that have the potential to emit two hundred fifty ton per year or more of any air pollutant except for those air pollutant such as carbon dioxide with respect to which regulation at that threshold would be impractical or absurd or would sweep in smaller source that congress do not mean to cover see ante at t here be no insuperable textual barrier to epa interpret any air pollutant in the permit trigger of psd and title v to encompass only pollutant emit in quantity that enable they to be sensibly regulate at the statutory threshold and to exclude those atypical pollutant that like greenhouse gas be emit in such vast quantity that they inclusion would radically transform those program and render they unworkable as write i agree with the court that the word any when use in a statute do not normally mean any in the universe fcc nextwave personal communications breyer dissent tell all customer that do not refer to every customer of every business in the world rather g eneral term as use on particular occasion often carry with they imply restriction as to scope and so court must interpret the word any like all other word in context as judge learned hand point out when interpret another statute many year ago w e can best reach the meaning here as always by recourse to the underlie purpose and with that as a guide by try to project upon the specific occasion how we think person actuate by such a purpose would have deal with it if it have be present to they at the time borella borden the pursuit of that underlie purpose may sometimes require we to abandon a literal interpretation of a word like any at the law have long recognize that term such as any admit of unwritten limitation and exception legal philosopher like to point out that a statute provide that w hoever shall willfully take the life of another shall be punish by death need not encompass a man who kill in nor must a ordinance impose fine upon those who occupy a public parking spot for more than two hour penalize a driver who be unable to move because of a parade see fuller the case of the

carrier the maxim cessante ratione legis cessat ipse lex where a law rationale cease to apply so do the law itself be not of recent origin see zadvydas davis cite coke institutes green liter cranch story cessante ratione cessat ipsa lex i also agree with the court point that a generic reference to air pollutant in the clean air act need not encompass every substance fall within the definition that we construe in massachusetts g see ante at as the court note the epa have interpret the phrase any air pollutant which be use several time in the act as limit to air pollutant for which epa have promulgate new source performance standard in the portion of the act deal with those standard as limit to air pollutant in the part of the act concern with deleterious effect on visibility and as limit to pollutant for which the area be designate nonattainment in the part of the act aim at region that fail to attain air quality standard ibid but i do not agree with the court that the only way to avoid a absurd or otherwise impermissible result in these case be to create a atextual greenhouse gas exception to the phrase any air pollutant after all the word any make a earlier appearance in the definitional provision which define major emit facility to mean any source with the potential to emit two hundred and fifty ton per year or more of any air pollutant emphasis add as a linguistic matter one can just as easily read a implicit exception for greenhouse gas emission into the phrase any source as into the phrase any air pollutant and give the purpose of the psd program and the act as a whole as well as the specific role of the different part of the statutory definition find flexibility in any source be far more sensible than the court route of find it in any air pollutant the implicit exception i propose read almost word for word the same as the court except that the location of the exception have shift to repeat the court read the definition of major emit facility as if it refer to any source with the potential to emit two hundred fifty ton per year or more of any air pollutant except for those air pollutant such as carbon dioxide with respect to which regulation at that threshold would be impractical or absurd or would sweep in smaller source that congress do not mean to cover i would simply move the implicit exception which i have italicize so that it apply to source rather than air pollutant any source with the potential to emit two hundred fifty ton per year or more of any air pollutant except for those source such as those emit unmanageably small amount of greenhouse gas with respect to which regulation at that threshold would be impractical or absurd or would sweep in smaller source that congress do not mean to cover from a legal administrative and functional perspective that be from a perspective that assume that congress be not merely try to arrange word on paper but be seek to achieve a purpose my way of read the statute be the more sensible one for one thing my reading be consistent with the specific purpose underlie the tpy threshold specify by the statute the purpose of that number be not to prevent the regulation of dangerous air pollutant that can not be sensibly regulate at that particular threshold though that be the effect that the court reading give the threshold rather the purpose be to limit the psd program obligation to larger source while exempt the many small source whose emission be low enough that impose burdensome regulatory requirement on they would be senseless thus the accompany senate report explain that the psd program be reasonable and necessary for very large source such as new electrical generate plant or new steel mill but the procedure would prove costly and potentially unreasonable if impose on construction of storage facility for a small gasoline jobber or on the construction of a new heating plant at a junior college and the principal sponsor of the clean air act amendment at issue here senator edmund muskie tell the senate that the program would not cover house dairy farm highway hospital school grocery store and other such source cong rec the epa exercise the legal authority to which it be entitle under chevron natural resources defense council understand the threshold purpose in the same light it explain that congress objective be to limit the psd program to large industrial source because it be those source that be the primary cause of the pollution problem in question and because those source would have the resource to comply with the psd requirement congress mechanism for limit psd be the tpy threshold limitation focus as it be primarily on naaqs pollutant that be those air pollutant for which the epa have issue a national ambient air quality standard under title i of the act see epa eme homer city generation slip at congress consider source that emit naaqs pollutant in those quantity generally to be the large industrial source to which it intend psd to be limit tailor rule fed reg the court similarly acknowledge that the psd program and title v be design to apply to and can not rationally be extend beyond a relative handful of large source capable of shoulder heavy substantive and procedural burden ante at see also alabama power costle cadc congress intention be to identify facility which due to they size be financially able to bear the substantial regulatory cost impose by the psd provision and which as a group be primarily responsible for emission of the deleterious pollutant that befoul we nation air a implicit exception would serve this statutory purpose while go no further the implicit exception that the court read into the phrase any air pollutant by contrast go well beyond the limited congressional objective nothing in the statutory text the legislative history or common sense suggest that congress when it impose the tpy threshold be try to undermine its own deliberate decision to use the broad language any air pollutant by remove some substance rather than some facility from the psd program coverage for another thing a exception serve the flexible nature of the clean air act we observe in massachusetts that w hile the congress that draft the act might not have appreciate the possibility that burn fossil fuel could lead to global warming they do understand that without regulatory flexibility change circumstance and scientific development would soon render the clean air act obsolete at we recognize that t he broad language of the definition of air pollutant reflect a intentional effort to confer the flexibility necessary to forestall such obsolescence ibid the court decision to read greenhouse gas out of the psd program drain the act of its flexibility and chip away at we decision in massachusetts what sense do it make to read the act as generally grant the epa the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emission and then to read it as deny that power with respect to the program for large stationary source at issue here it be anomalous to read the act to require the epa to regulate air pollutant that pose previously unforeseen threat to human health and welfare where ton per year be a sensible regulatory line but not where by chemical or regulatory happenstance a higher line must be draw and it be anomalous to read a unwritten exception into the more important phrase of the statutory definition any air pollutant when a similar unwritten exception to less important language the particular number use by the statute will do just as well the implicit exception prefer by the court produce all of these anomaly while the exception i propose create none of they in addition the interpretation i propose leave the epa with the sort of discretion as to interstitial matter that congress likely intend it to retain my interpretation give the epa nothing more than the authority to exempt source from regulation insofar as the agency reasonably determine that apply the psd program to they would expand the program so much as to contravene congress intent that sort of decision which involve the agency technical expertise and administrative experience be the kind of decision that congress typically leave to the agency to make barnhart walton enumerate factor that we take to indicate that congress intend the agency to exercise the discretion provide by chevron to read the act to grant that discretion here be to read it as further congress and the public interest in more effective less wasteful regulation last but by no means least a exception advance the act overall purpose that broad purpose as set forth at the beginning of the statute be to protect and enhance the quality of the nation air resource so as to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of its population b see also a purpose of the psd program in particular be to protect public health and welfare from any actual or potential adverse effect which in the administrator judgment may reasonably be anticipate d to occur from air pollution h all language in the act refer to effect on welfare include effect on weather and climate the expert agency charge with administer the act have determine in its endangerment find that greenhouse gas endanger human health and welfare and so sensible regulation of industrial emission of those pollutant be at the core of the purpose behind the act the broad no greenhouse gas exception that the court read into the statute unnecessarily undercut that purpose while my narrow exception would leave the agency with the tool it need to further it i agree with the court hold that stationary source that be subject to the psd program because they emit other pollutant in quantity above the statutory threshold those facility that the court refer to as anyway source must meet the best available control technology requirement of a with respect to greenhouse gas emission i therefore join part of the court opinion but as for the court hold that the epa can not interpret the language at issue here to cover facility that emit more than tpy of greenhouse gas by virtue of those emission i respectfully dissent opinion of alito and et et et et et et et et et and et et on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the district of columbia circuit june justice alito with whom justice thomas join concur in part and dissent in part in massachusetts epa this court consider whether greenhouse gas fall within the clean air act general definition of a air pollutant at the environmental protection agency caution we that key provision of the act can not cogently be apply to greenhouse gas emission brief for federal respondent in massachusetts epa but the court brush the warning aside and have little trouble conclude that the act sweeping definition of a pollutant encompass greenhouse gas at i believe massachusetts epa be wrongly decide at the time and these case further expose the flaw with that decision i as the present case now show try to fit greenhouse gas into key provision of the clean air act involve more than a little trouble these case concern the provision of the act relate to the prevention of significant deterioration psd as well as title v of the act and in order to make those provision apply to greenhouse gas in a way that do not produce absurd result the epa effectively amend the act the act contain specific emission threshold that trigger psd and title v coverage but the epa cross out the figure enact by congress and substitute figure of its own i agree with the court that the epa be neither require nor permit to take this extraordinary step and i therefore join part i and of the court opinion ii i do not agree however with the court conclusion that what it term anyway source source that be subject to psd and title v permit as the result of the emission of conventional pollutant must install best available control technology bact for greenhouse gas as be the case with the psd and title v threshold try to fit greenhouse gas into the bact analysis badly distort the scheme that congress adopt the court give two main reason for conclude that bact apply to anyway source one base on text and one base on practical consideration neither be convincing a with respect to the text it be curious that the court have depart from a literal interpretation of the term pollutant in part turn on its heel and adopt a literal interpretation in part the coverage threshold at issue in part apply to any pollutant the act general definition of this term be broad and in massachusetts epa supra the court hold that this definition cover greenhouse gas the court do not disturb that holding but it nevertheless conclude that as use in the provision trigger psd coverage the term pollutant actually mean pollutant other than a greenhouse gas in part the relevant statutory provision say that bact must be install for any pollutant subject to regulation under the act a if the term pollutant means pollutant other than a greenhouse gas as the court effectively conclude in part the term pollutant subject to regulation under the act in a should mean pollutant other than a greenhouse gas subject to regulation under the act and that be subject to regulation under the act the court literalism be selective and it result in a strange and disjointed regulatory scheme under the court interpretation a source can emit a unlimited quantity of greenhouse gas without trigger the need for a psd permit why might congress have want to allow this the most likely explanation be that the psd permit process be simply not suit for use in regulate this particular pollutant and if that be so it make little sense to require the installation of bact for greenhouse gas in those instance in which a source happen to be require to obtain a permit due to the emission of a qualify quantity of some other pollutant that be regulate under the act b the court second reason for hold that bact apply to anyway source be its belief that this can be do without disastrous consequence only time will tell whether this hope be well found but it seem clear that bact analysis be fundamentally incompatible with the regulation of emission for at least two important reason first bact look to the effect of covered pollutant in the area in which a source be located the psd program be implement through emission limitation and such other measure as be necessary to prevent significant deterioration of air quality in each region emphasis add the clean air act provide that bact must be identify on a basis and this necessarily mean that local condition must be take into account for this reason the act instruct the epa to issue regulation require a analysis of the ambient air quality at the site of the propose major emit facil ity and in the area potentially affect by the emission from such facility for each pollutant regulate under the act e b emphasis add the act also require a public hearing on the air quality at the proposed site and in area which may be affect by emission from such facility for each pollutant subject to regulation under the act which will be emit from such facility a e emphasis add accordingly if bact be require for greenhouse gas the act demand that the impact of these gas in the area surround a site must be monitor explore at a public hearing and consider as part of the permit process the effect of greenhouse gas however be global not local see psd and title v permitting guidance for greenhouse gas hereinafter guidance as a result the epa have declare that psd permit applicant and permit official may disregard these provision of the act fed reg second as part of the analysis require by bact a permit authority must balance the environmental benefit expect to result from the installation of a available control measure against adverse consequence that may result include any negative impact on the environment energy conservation and the economy and the epa itself have admit that this can not be do on a basis with respect to greenhouse gas the clean air act make it clear that bact must be determine on a basis take into account energy environmental and economic impact and other cost to implement this directive the epa adopt a framework for make a bact determination see new source review workshop manual prevention of significant deterioration and nonattainment area permitting under the fourth step of this analysis potentially applicable and feasible control technology that be candidate for selection as bact for a particular source be eliminate from consideration base on they collateral impact such as any adverse environmental effect or adverse effect on energy consumption or the economy more recently the epa provide guidance to permit authority regard the treatment of emission under this framework and the epa guidance demonstrate the insuperable problem that result when a attempt be make to apply this framework to greenhouse gas emission as note above at step of the framework a permit authority must balance the positive effect likely to result from require a particular source to install a particular technology against a variety of negative effect that be likely to occur if that step be take but in the case of greenhouse gas how can a permit authority make this individualized determination the epa instruct permit authority to take into consideration all the adverse effect that the epa have find to result from the overall increase in greenhouse gas in the atmosphere these include a increase risk of dangerous heat wave hurricane flood wildfire and drought as well as risk to agriculture forestry and water resource guidance but the epa admit that it be simply not possible for a permit authority to calculate in any meaningful way the degree to which any potential reduction in greenhouse gas emission from any individual source might reduce these risk and without make such a calculation in even a very rough way a permit authority can not do what the clean air act and the epa framework demand compare the benefit of some specified reduction in the emission of greenhouse gas from a particular source with any adverse environmental or economic effect that might result from mandate such a reduction suppose for example that a permit authority must decide whether to mandate a change that both decrease a source emission of greenhouse gas and increase its emission of a conventional pollutant that have a negative effect on public health how should a permit authority decide whether to require this change here be the epa advice w hen consider the between the environmental impact of a particular level of ghg greenhouse gas reduction and a collateral increase in another regulate nsr pollutant rather than attempt to determine or characterize specific environmental impact from ghg emit at particular location epa recommend that permit authority focus on the amount of ghg emission reduction that may be gain or lose by employ a particular control strategy and how that compare to the environmental or other impact result from the collateral emission increase of other regulate nsr pollutant guidance as best i can make out what this mean be that permit authority should not even try to assess the net impact on public health instead of compare the positive and negative public health effect of a particular option permit authority be instruct to compare the adverse public health effect of increase the emission of the conventional pollutant with the amount of the reduction of the source emission of greenhouse gas but without know the positive effect of the latter this be a meaningless comparison the epa try to ameliorate this problem by note that permit authority be entitle to a great deal of discretion guidance but without a comprehensible standard what this will mean be arbitrary and inconsistent decisionmaking that be not what the clean air act contemplate bact analysis like the rest of the clean air act be develop for use in regulate the emission of conventional pollutant and be simply not suit for use with respect to greenhouse gas i therefore respectfully dissent from part of the opinion of the court footnote footnote together with american chemistry council et environmental

numerical threshold or ton per year for emission that will make a facility major it do not specify by how much a physical or operational change must increase emission to constitute a modification nor do it say how much of a give regulate pollutant a major emit facility must emit before it be subject to bact for that pollutant epa however have establish numerical threshold below which a facility

of appeals hold that petitioner argument apply only to the psd program and that petitioner have therefore forfeit any challenge to epa greenhouse interpretation of title at the solicitor general do

respondents we agree and we be satisfied that those argument be also make below see brief for state petitioners et in cadc brief for petitioners et in cadc footnote we decision in american power

seek abatement of those emission at slip at the authorization to which we refer be that give in the nsps program of a part of the act not at issue here and one that no party in american electric power argue be ill suit to accommodate greenhouse gas footnote during the course of this litigation several possible limit construction for the psd trigger have be propose judge kavanaugh argue below that it would be plausible for epa to read any air pollutant in the psd context as limit to the six naaqs pollutant see coalition for responsible regulation epa cadc app wl opinion dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc some petitioner make a slightly different argument that because psd permit be require only for major emit facility in any area to which the psd program apply a the relevant pollutant be only those naaqs pollutant for which the area in question be designate attainment or unclassifiable that approach would bring epa interpretation of the psd trigger in line with its longstanding interpretation of the permit requirement for nonattainment area other maintain that any air pollutant in the psd provision should be limit to air pollutant with localized effect on air quality we do not foreclose epa or the court from consider those construction in the future but we need not do so today footnote a few additional point bear mention the solicitor general conjecture that epa might eventually alter its longstanding interpretation of potential to emit in order to reduce the number of source require to have permit at the statutory threshold but neither he nor the agency have give we any reason to believe that there exist a plausible reading of potential to emit that epa would willingly adopt and that would eliminate the unreasonableness of epa interpretation nor have we be give any information about the ability of other possible streamline technique allude to by epa such as general or electronic permit to reduce the administrability problem identify above and in any event none of those technique would address the more fundamental problem of epa claim regulatory authority over million of small entity that it acknowledge the act do not seek to regulate finally the solicitor general suggest that the incompatibility of greenhouse gas with the psd program and title v result chiefly from the inclusion of carbon dioxide in the aggregate pollutant define by epa we decide these case on the basis of the pollutant greenhouse gas as epa have define and regulate it and we express no view on how we analysis might change be epa to define it differently footnote justice breyer argue post at opinion concurring in part and dissent in part that when the statutory permit threshold of or ton per year do not provide a sensible regulatory line epa be entitle to read a unwritten exception into the particular number use by the statute by which he apparently mean that the agency be entitle to substitute a dramatically higher number such as we be aware of no principle of administrative law that would allow a agency to rewrite such a clear statutory term and we shudder to contemplate the effect that such a principle would have on democratic governance justice breyer however claim to perceive no difference between a read the statute to exclude greenhouse gas from the term any air pollutant in the permit trigger and b read the statute to exclude source emit less than ton per year from the statutory phrase any source with the potential to emit two hundred and fifty ton per year or more see post at the two could scarcely be further apart as we have explain and as epa agree statutory context make plain that the act operative provision use air pollutant to denote less than the full range of pollutant cover by the definition see part supra it be therefore incumbent on epa to specify the pollutant encompass by that term in the context of a particular program and to do so reasonably in light of that program overall regulatory scheme but there be no ambiguity whatsoever in the specific numerical permit threshold and thus no room for epa to exercise discretion in select a different threshold footnote justice alito argue that bact be fundamentally incompatible with greenhouse gas for two reason post at opinion concurring in part and dissent in part first bact require consideration of ambient air quality at the proposed site and in area which may be affect by emission from the propose facility for each pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter e see also e b and it be not obvious how that requirement should apply or even whether it can apply to greenhouse gas post at but the possibility that that requirement may be inoperative as to greenhouse gas do not convince we that they must be categorically exclude from bact even though they be indisputably a pollutant subject to regulation second justice alito argue that epa guidance on how to implement bact be a recipe for arbitrary and inconsistent decisionmaking post at but we be not review epa guidance in these case and we can not say that it be impossible for epa and state permit authority to devise rational way of comply with the statute directive to determine bact for greenhouse gas on a basis take into account energy environmental and economic impact and other cost footnote footnote the epa describe these step as follow the applicant must identify all available control option that be potentially applicable by consult epa bact clearinghouse along with other reliable source the technical feasibility of the control option
