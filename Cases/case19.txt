the immigration and nationality act permit qualify citizen and lawful permanent resident lpr to petition for certain family member to obtain immigrant visa a sponsor individual know as the principal

to the same status and order of consideration as the principal d the beneficiary then become eligible to apply for visa in order of priority date that be the date a petition be file e because the immigration process often take year or decade to complete a child seek to immigrate may age out reach adulthood and lose she immigration status before she reach the front of the visa queue the child status protection act cspa set forth a remedy in that circumstance provide that i f the age of a alien be determine to be year of age or older notwithstanding certain allowance for bureaucratic delay h the alien petition shall automatically be convert to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issue upon receipt of the original petition h respondent principal beneficiary who become lpr file petition for they child assert that the newly file petition should receive the same priority date as they original petition instead citizenship and immigration services uscis give the new petition current priority date the district court grant the government summary judgment defer to the board of immigration appeals bia determination that only those petition that can be seamlessly convert from one family preference category to another without the need for a new sponsor be entitle to conversion under h the en banc ninth circuit reverse hold that the provision unambiguously entitle all derivative beneficiary to automatic conversion and priority date retention hold the judgment be reverse and the case be remand reverse and remand justice kagan join by justice kennedy and justice ginsburg conclude that the bia textually reasonable construction of h ambiguous language be entitle to deference a because h do not speak unambiguously to the issue here a court must defer to the bia reasonable interpretation see chevron natural resources defense council the first clause of h state a condition that encompass every beneficiary of a family preference petition the second clause however do not easily cohere with the first it prescribe a remedy that can apply to only a subset of the beneficiary describe in the first clause this remedial prescription direct immigration official to take the alien petition and convert it from a category benefit a child to a appropriate category for adult without any change in the petition include its sponsor or any new filing moreover this conversion be to be automati c that be one involve no additional decision contingency or delay thus the only alien who may benefit from h back half be those for whom automatic conversion be possible the understanding that automatic conversion entail nothing more than pick up the petition from one category and drop it into another for which the alien now qualify match the exclusive way immigration law use the term when h be enact see cfr i and congress use the word conversion in the identical way elsewhere in the cspa see f if the term mean more than that in h it would undermine the family preference system core premise that each immigrant must have a qualify and willing sponsor see a b if a original sponsor do not have a legally recognize relationship with the derivative beneficiary another sponsor the old principal beneficiary must be swap in for the alien to qualify for a new family preference category but immigration official can not assume that a new sponsor be eligible and willing to petition on the alien behalf give the numerous requirement the law impose on family preference petitioner see a b i ii can they figure out whether a valid sponsor exist unless he file and usci approve a new petition the very thing h say be not require in any case a new qualified sponsor will rarely exist at the requisite time a alien be deem to age out on the date on which a immigrant visa number become available for the alien parent h a since age out trigger automatic conversion the date of automatic conversion be best view as the same but at that time the beneficiary parent can not yet be a citizen or lpr and so no new qualified sponsor will be ready to step into the old one shoe on the above account h second clause provide a remedy to those principal and derivative beneficiary who have a qualify relationship with a lpr both before and after they age out in contrast alien like respondent child the niece nephew and grandchild of the initial sponsor can not qualify for automatic conversion they lack a qualify preference relationship with the initial petitioner and so can not fit into a new preference category without obtain a new sponsor the ambiguity create by h clause leave the bia to choose how to reconcile the statute different command it reasonably opt to abide by the inherent limit of h remedial clause rather than go beyond those limit so as to match the sweep of the first clause condition when a agency thus resolve statutory tension ordinary principle of administrative deference require this court to defer see national of home builders defender of wildlife b respondent take issue with the bia interpretation but none of they contention be persuasive respondent aver that every beneficiary could be automatically convert if immigration official substitute new sponsor and manage the timing of conversion so that a new sponsor exist on the relevant date these administrative maneuver be not in keep with the natural and meaning of automatic conversion they require conversion to occur on a date that have no connection to the alien age out and they demand administrative juggling to make automatic conversion work and that painstakingly manage process still can not succeed because a derivative parent may never become able to sponsor a visa and immigration official can not practicably tell whether a give parent have do so respondent argue that the word and in the second clause of h indicate that priority date retention be a benefit wholly independent of automatic conversion but and do not necessarily disjoin two phrase and context suggest that the instruction work in tandem in other statutory and regulatory provision respect conversion retention of a priority date be conditional on a conversion occur see k respondent reading would make priority date retention conditional on something the statute nowhere mention and it would engender unusual result that without some clearer statement the court can not conclude that congress intend finally respondent contend that assume h be ambiguous the bia act unreasonably in choose the more restrictive reading but the bia interpretation benefit from administrative simplicity and fit with immigration law basic rule by contrast respondent would scramble the priority order congress establish by allow derivative beneficiary like respondent son and daughter to enter the visa queue ahead of beneficiary who have a qualify relationship with a lpr for a far longer time the chief justice join by justice scalia agree that the bia interpretation be reasonable but not because a agency have authority to resolve direct conflict within a statute there be no conflict or internal tension in h the first clause of the provision define the person potentially affect but do not grant anything to anyone the particular benefit provide by the statute automatic conversion and retention of priority date be find exclusively in the second clause and that relief require at minimum that a beneficiary have he own eligible sponsor who be commit to provide financial support for the beneficiary beyond that congress do not speak clearly to which petition can be automatically convert the bia reasonable interpretation of h be consistent with the ordinary meaning of the statutory term with the established meaning of

state citizenship and immigration service et petitioners rosa lina cuellar de osorio et on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the ninth circuit june justice kagan announce the judgment of the court and deliver a opinion in which justice kennedy and justice ginsburg join under the immigration and nationality act et citizen and lawful permanent resident lpr of the united states may petition for certain family member spouse sibling and child of various age to obtain immigrant visa such a sponsor individual be know as the petition principal beneficiary in turn any principal beneficiary minor child mean a unmarried child under the age of qualify as a derivative beneficiary entitle to the same immigration status and order of consideration as he parent d accordingly when a visa become available to the petition principal beneficiary one also become available to she minor child but what happen if sometime after the relevant petition be file a minor child whether a principal or a derivative beneficiary have turn or in immigration lingo have age out the immigration process may take year or even decade to complete due in part to bureaucratic delay associate with review immigration document and in still greater part to long queue for the limited number of visa available each year so someone who be a youngster at the start of the process may be a adult at the end and no longer qualify for a immigration status give to minor the child status protection act cspa stat ensure that the time government official have spend processing immigration papers will not count against the beneficiary in assess he status see h but even with that provision the beneficiary may age out solely because of the time he spend wait in line for a visa to become available the question present in this case be whether the cspa grant a remedy to all alien who have thus outpace the immigration process that be all alien who count as child beneficiary when a sponsor petition be file but no longer do so even after exclude administrative delay by the time they reach the front of the visa queue the board of immigration appeals bia or board say no it interpret the cspa as provide relief to only a subset of that group specifically those alien who qualify or could have qualify as principal beneficiary of a visa petition rather than only as derivative beneficiary on a parent we now uphold the board determination as a permissible construction of the statute i a a alien need a immigrant visa to enter and permanently reside in the united states see a to obtain that highly document the alien must fall within one of a limited number of immigration category see a b the most favored be for the immediate relative of citizen they parent spouse and unmarried child under the age of see b a i b five other category crucial to this case and often denominate preference category be for immigrant who include more distant or independent relative of citizen and certain close relative of lpr specifically those family preference category be the unmarried adult or over son and daughter of citizen the spouse and unmarried minor under child of lpr the unmarried adult or over son and daughter of lpr the married son and daughter of citizen the brother and sister of citizen a a a word to the wise this page for easy reference because these category crop up regularly throughout this opinion the road to obtain any immigrant visa begin when a sponsor citizen or lpr file a petition on behalf of a foreign relative term the principal beneficiary see a a i a b i i b cfr a the sponsor otherwise know as the petitioner we use the word interchangeably must provide citizenship and immigration services uscis with evidence showing among other thing that she have the necessary familial relationship with the beneficiary see a d g and that she have not commit any conduct disqualify she from sponsor a alien for a visa see a b i ii bar a lpr from submit a petition if she have commit certain offens against minor uscis thereafter review the petition and approve it if find to meet all requirement see b for a family preference beneficiary that approval result not in get a visa then and there but only in get a place in line the case be different for immediate relative of citizen who can apply for and receive a visa as soon as a sponsor petition be approve the law cap the number of visa issue each year in the five family preference category see c a and demand regularly exceed the supply as a consequence the principal beneficiary of a approve petition be place in a queue with other in she category or what have you in order of priority date that be the date a petition be file with uscis see e cfr b cfr a every month the department of state set a date for each family preference category indicate that visa sometimes refer to by visa number be available for beneficiary with priority date earlier than the see cfr g cfr b the system be thus within each preference category with visa become available in order of priority date such a date may benefit not only the principal beneficiary of a family preference petition but also she spouse and minor child those person label the petition derivative beneficiar ie be entitle to the same status and the same order of consideration as the principal d h accordingly when a visa become available for the principal one become available for she spouse and minor child too and that be so even when as be usually but not always the case the spouse and child would not qualify for any family preference category on they own for example the child of a petition principal beneficiary be the niece or nephew of a citizen and federal immigration law do not recognize that relationship nonetheless the child can on he qualify parent in seek a immigrant visa although as will be further discuss he may not immigrate without she see cfr a infra at once visa become available the principal and any derivative beneficiary must separately file visa application see a such a application require a alien to demonstrate in various way she admissibility to the united states see a a alien may not have serious health problem a a alien may not have be convict of certain crime a b alien may not have engage in terrorist activity notably one necessary show involve the citizen or lpr who file the initial petition to mitigate any possibility of become a public charge the visa applicant whether a principal or derivative beneficiary must append a affidavit of support execute by that sponsor individual a c ii a such a affidavit legally commit the sponsor to support the alien usually for at least year with a annual income not less than of the federal poverty line a a see a after the beneficiary have file they application a consular official review the document and if everything be in order schedule interview see h the interview for a principal and she child or spouse usually occur although those for the child may also come later the consular official will determine first whether the principal should receive a visa if but only if the answer be yes the official will then consider the derivative application see cfr a a provide all go well everyone exit the consulate with visa in hand but that still do not make they lpr see e each approve alien must then travel to the united states within a set time undergo inspection and confirm she admissibility see c a b once again a derivative fate be tie to the principal if the principal can not enter the country neither can she child or spouse see d cfr a when but only when a alien with a immigrant visa be approve at the border do she finally become a lpr b all of this take time and often a lot of it at the front end many month may go by before uscis approve the initial sponsor petition on the back end several additional month may elapse while a consular official consider the alien visa application and schedule a interview and the middle be the worst after a sponsor petition be approve but before a visa application can be file a immigrant may stand in line for year or even decade just wait for a immigrant visa to become available see of state bureau of consular affairs visa bulletin immigrant numbers for december and as the year tick by young people grow up and thereby endanger they immigration status remember that not all offspring but only those under the age of can qualify as a immediate relative of a citizen or as the principal beneficiary of a lpr petition or most crucially here as the derivative beneficiary of any family preference petition see supra at so a alien eligible to immigrate at the start of the process when a sponsor file a petition might not be so at the end when a immigration official review he document for admission he may have age out of he original immigration status by the simple passage of time in congress enact the child status protection act cspa stat to address the treatment of those alien one section of the act neatly eliminate the age out problem for the offspring of citizen seek to immigrate as immediate relative under that provision the determination of whether such a alien satisfy the immigration law age requirement shall be make use he age on the date the initial petition be file f the section thus halt the flow of time for that group of immigrant if a alien be young when a citizen sponsor he entry then peter he remain young throughout the immigration process a different scheme and one not nearly so limpid apply to the offspring of lpr and alien who initially qualify as either principal beneficiary of petition or derivative beneficiary of any kind of family preference petition section of the cspa now codify at h contain three interlinked paragraph that mitigate the age out problem for those prospective immigrant the first two be complex but with some perseverance comprehensible the third the key provision here be through and through perplexing the first paragraph h contain a formula for calculate the age of a alien f or purpose of subsection a a and d that be for any alien seek a immigrant visa directly under or as a derivative beneficiary of any preference category the determination of whether such a alien satisfy the immigration law age requirement that be count as under shall be make use a the age of the alien on the date on which a immigrant visa number become available for such alien or in the case of derivative beneficiary the date on which a immigrant visa number become available for the alien parent reduce by b the number of day in the period during which the applicable petition describe in paragraph be pend h the second paragraph h then explain that the applicable petition mention be the petition cover the give alien so again either a petition file on he own behalf or any petition extend to he as a derivative take together those two paragraph prevent a alien from age out because of but only because of bureaucratic delay the time government official spend review or get around to review paperwork at what we have call the front and back end of the immigration process see supra at the month that elapse before usci personnel approve a family preference petition the period during which the applicable petition describe in paragraph be pend do not count against a alien in determine he statutory age neither do the month a consular officer let pass before adjudicate the alien own visa application the period after a immigrant visa number become available for such alien or he parent but the time in between the month or more likely year the alien spend simply wait for a visa to become available be not similarly exclude in calculate he age every day the alien stand in that line be a day he grow older under the immigration law no less than in life and so derivative beneficiary as well as principal beneficiary of petition can still age out in other word turn notwithstanding h dual age adjustment prior to receive a opportunity to immigrate what happen then if anything be the subject of h third paragraph the provision at issue in this case that paragraph state if the age of a alien be determine under paragraph to be year of age or older for the purpose of subsection a a and d of this section the alien petition shall automatically be convert to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issue upon receipt of the original petition the provision thus first reference the beneficiary of family preference petition and then direct immigration official to do something whose meaning this opinion will further consider automatically convert a alien petition to a appropriate category the board of immigration appeals bia address the meaning of h in matter of wang its interpretation there be what we review in this case wang be the principal beneficiary of a petition that he sister a citizen file in at that time wang daughter be year old and thus qualify as a derivative beneficiary but wang wait in line for a visa for more than a decade and by the time he priority date finally come up he daughter have turn even after apply h formula wang thus obtain a visa for himself board a plane alone and enter the united states as a lpr he then file a new preference petition on he daughter behalf this one under the category for lpr adult son and daughter uscis approve that petition with a priority date correspond to the date of wang filing wang contend that under h he daughter be instead entitle to retain the original priority date give to he sister old petition because that petition could automatically be convert to the category the board reject that argument it explain that the language of h do not expressly state which petition qualify for automatic conversion and retention of priority date at give that ambiguity the bia look to the recognize meaning of the phrase automatic conversion in immigration statute and regulation which it presume d congress understand when enact the cspa at historically the bia show that language apply only when a petition could move seamlessly from one family preference category to another not when a new sponsor be need to fit a beneficiary into a different category at some alien petition could accomplish that maneuver because the alien have a qualify relationship with the original sponsor and continue to do so upon age out in that event the board hold h ensure that the alien would retain he original priority date see at but the petition file by wang sister could not automatically be convert in that way because wang daughter never have a qualify relationship with the sponsor n o category exist for the niece of a united states citizen at that be why wang himself have to file a new petition on he daughter behalf once she age out and could no longer ride on he sibling status the board see no evidence that congress mean to expand the use of the concept of automatic conversion to reach such a case at and the board think such a expansion unwarranted because it would allow alien like wang daughter who lack any independent entitlement to a visa during the year she father spend stand on the queue to cut in line ahead of other await visa in other preference category at c the respondent in this case be similarly situate to wang and they seek the same relief each be once the principal beneficiary of either a petition file by a citizen parent or a petition file by a citizen sibling each also have a son or daughter who on the date of filing be under and thus qualify as a derivative beneficiary of the petition but as be true of wang daughter the respondent offspring have all turn even account for h age adjustment by the time visa become available accordingly the respondent immigrate to the united states alone and as new lpr file petition for they son and daughter each argue that under h those petition should get the same priority date as the original and petition once have uscis instead give the new petition current priority date mean that the son and daughter could not leapfrog over other in the line this case begin as two separate suit one join many individual plaintiff and the other certify as a class action in each suit the district court defer to the bia interpretation of h in wang and accordingly grant summary judgment to the government see zhang napolitano supp cd cal costelo chertoff no wl cd after consolidate the two case on appeal a panel of the ninth circuit affirm like the lower court it find h ambiguous and accede to the bia construction the ninth circuit then grant rehearing en banc and reverse in a decision the majority conclude that the plain language of the cspa unambiguously grant automatic conversion and priority date retention to all derivative beneficiary and that the board contrary conclusion be not entitle to deference at we grant certiorari to resolve a circuit split on the meaning of h and we now reverse the ninth circuit decision ii principle of chevron deference apply when the bia interpret the immigration law see chevron natural resources defense council ins indeed judicial deference to the executive branch be especially appropriate in the immigration context where decision about a complex statutory scheme often implicate foreign relation at those hardy reader who have make it this far will surely agree with the complexity point under chevron the statute plain meaning control whatever the board might have to say see at but if the law do not speak clearly to the question at issue a court must defer to the board reasonable interpretation rather than substitute its own reading at and h do not speak unambiguously to the issue here or more precisely put it address that issue in divergent way we might call the provision its first half look in one direction toward the sweeping relief the respondent propose which would reach every beneficiary of a family preference petition but as the bia recognize and we will further explain the section second half look another way toward a remedy that can apply to only a subset of those beneficiary and one not include the respondent offspring the two face of the statute do not easily cohere with each other read either most naturally and the other appear to mean not what it say that internal tension make possible alternative reasonable construction bring into correspondence in one way or another the section different part and when that be so chevron dictate that a court defer to the agency choice here to the board expert judgment about which interpretation fit best with and make most sense of the statutory scheme begin by read the statute from the top the part favor the respondent section h first clause if the age of a alien be determine under paragraph to be year of age or older for the purpose of subsection a a and d state a condition that every beneficiary of a preference petition satisfy that be because all those beneficiary have have they age determine under paragraph and have come up want recall that the age formula of h apply to each alien child who originally qualify under subsection a a and d as the principal beneficiary of a petition or the derivative beneficiary of any family preference petition on its own then h open clause encompass the respondent son and daughter along with every other beneficiary of a family preference petition now on the wrong side of if the next phrase say something like the alien shall be treat as though still a minor much as the cspa do to ensure citizen child qualify as immediate relative would stay forever young see supra at all those beneficiary would prevail in this case but read on because h second clause instead prescribe a remedy contain its own limitation on the eligible class of recipient t he alien petition that part provide shall automatically be convert to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date that statement direct immigration official to take the initial petition benefit a alien child and now that he have turn convert that same petition from a category for child to a appropriate category for adult while let he keep the old priority date the conversion in other word be merely from one category to another it do not entail any change in the petition include its sponsor let alone any new filing and more that category shift be to be automatic that be one involve no additional decision contingency or delay see random house webster unabridged dictionary ed define automatic as have the capability of start operate move independently the american heritage dictionary ed a cting or operating in a manner essentially independent of external influence the operation describe be then a mechanical job move a petition without any substantive alteration from one category to another adult compartment and so the alien who may benefit from h back half be only those for whom that procedure be possible the clause offer relief not to every beneficiary but just to those cover by petition that can roll over seamlessly and promptly into a category for adult relative that understanding of h automatic conversion language match the exclusive way immigration law use the term when congress enact the cspa for many year before then as today a regulation entitle automatic conversion of preference classification instruct immigration official to change the preference category of a petition principal beneficiary when either he or he sponsor status change in specify way see cfr i for example the regulation provide that when a citizen child age out he immediate relative petition convert to a petition with he original priority date leave intact see i similarly when a citizen adult son marry he original petition migrate from to see i i when conversely such a person divorce he petition convert from to see i iii and when a minor child lpr parent become a citizen he petition become a immediate relative petition see i all again with they original priority date most notable here what all of those authorize change have in common be that they could occur without any change in the petitioner identity or otherwise in the petition content in each circumstance the automatic conversion entail nothing more than pick up the petition from one category and drop it into another for which the alien now qualify congress use the word conversion even without the modifier automatic in the identical way in two other section of the cspa see law siegel slip at w ord repeat in different part of the same statute generally have the same meaning section refer to occasion on which by virtue of the regulation a petition convert from to the immediate relative category because of the sponsor parent naturalization or from the to the box because of the beneficiary divorce f then in congress authorize a additional conversion of the same nature it direct that when a lpr naturalize the petition he have file for he adult son or daughter shall be convert unless the beneficiary object from the to the compartment again with the original priority date unchanged k that mechanism itself underscore the otherwise mechanical nature of the conversion once again in those case all that be involve be a recategorization move the same petition file by the same petitioner from one preference classification to another so as to reflect a change in either the alien or he sponsor status in the rest of the cspa as in the prior immigration regulation that be what conversion means and if the term mean more than that in h it would undermine the family preference system core premise that each immigrant must have a qualified sponsor consider the alternative address in wang if automatic conversion be also to encompass the substitution of a new petitioner for the old one to make sure the alien petition fit into a new preference category in a case like wang recall the original sponsor do not have a legally recognize relationship with the derivative beneficiary they be aunt and niece accordingly the derivative father the old principal beneficiary must be swap in as the petitioner to enable he daughter to immigrate but what if at that point the father be in no position to sponsor he daughter suppose he decide in the end not to immigrate or fail to pass border inspection or die in the meanwhile or suppose he enter the country but can not sponsor a relative visa because he lack adequate proof of parentage or commit a disqualify crime see a b i ii cfr d supra at or suppose he do not want to or simply can not undertake the significant financial obligation that the law impose on someone petition for a alien admission see a a f d supra at immigration official can not assume away all those potential barrier to entry that would run counter to the family preference system insistence that a qualify and willing sponsor back every immigrant visa see a b but neither can they easily or perhaps at all figure out whether such a sponsor exist unless he file and usci approve a new petition the very thing h say be not require indeed in case like wang the problem be broader under the statute most natural reading a new qualified sponsor will hardly ever exist at the moment the petition be to be convert section h to be sure do not explicitly identify that point in time but h specify the date on which a derivative beneficiary be deem to have either age out or not it be the date on which a immigrant visa number become available for the alien parent see h a b because that statutory aging out be the one and only thing that trigger automatic conversion for eligible alien the date of conversion be best view as the same that reading moreover comport with the automatic conversion regulation on which congress draw in enact the cspa see supra at the rule authorize conversion upon or as of the date of the relevant change in the alien status include turn regardless when uscis may receive notice of the change cfr i but post at sotomayor dissent wrongly state that under that rule conversion occur upon the agency receipt of proof of the change but on that date no new petitioner will be ready to step into the old one shoe if such a substitution be need to fit a beneficiary into a different category the beneficiary parent on the day a visa number become available can not yet be a lpr or citizen by definition she have just become eligible to apply for a visa and face a wait of at least several month before she can sponsor a alien herself nor except in a trivial number of case be any hitherto unidentified person likely to have a legally recognize relationship to the alien so if a beneficiary have lose he qualify connection to the original petitioner no conversion to a appropriate category can take place at the requisite time as long as immigration law demand some valid sponsor h can not give such a alien the designate relief on the above account in which conversion entail a simple reslotting of a original petition into a category h back half provide a remedy to two group of beneficiary first any child who be the principal beneficiary of a petition file by a lpr parent on he behalf can take advantage of that clause after turn he be upon age out the adult son of the same lpr who sponsor he as a child he petition can therefore be move seamlessly without the slightest alteration or delay into the category second any child who be the derivative beneficiary of a petition file by a lpr on he spouse behalf can similarly claim relief provide that under the statute he be not just the spouse but also the petitioner child such a alien be identically situate to the principal beneficiary of a petition indeed for the price of another filing fee he could just as easily have be name a principal himself he too be now the adult son of the original lpr petitioner and he petition can also be instantly relabel a petition without any need to substitute a new sponsor or make other revision in each case the alien have a qualify relationship before he be and retain it afterward all that must be change be the label affix to he petition in contrast as the board hold in wang the derivative beneficiary of the other family preference category like the son and daughter of the respondent here can not qualify for automatic conversion recall that the respondent themselves be principal beneficiary of and petition they child when under count as derivative but lack any qualify preference relationship of they own the derivative be the petitioner grandson and granddaughter the derivative they nephew and niece and none of those be relationship congress have recognize as warrant a family preference see a now that the respondent child have turn and they can no longer ride on they parent coattail that lack of independent eligibility make a difference for they unlike for the beneficiary it be impossible simply to slide the original petition from a child category to a adult one to fit into a new category those derivative like wang daughter must have new sponsor and for all the reason already state that need mean they can not benefit from automatic conversion all that say we hold only that h permit not that it require the board decision to so distinguish among beneficiary that be because as we explain earlier the two half of h face in different direction see supra at section h first part its conditional phrase encompass every beneficiary of a family preference petition and thus point toward relief but as just show h second part its remedial prescription apply only to a narrower class of beneficiary those alien who naturally qualify for and so can be automatically convert to a new preference classification when they age out be there a interpretation that give each clause full effect the board would have be require to adopt it but the ambiguity those clause create instead leave the board with a choice essentially of how to reconcile the statute different command the board recognize the need to make that call opt to abide by the inherent limit of h remedial clause rather than go beyond those limit so as to match the sweep of the section initial condition on the board reason view the only beneficiary entitle to statutory relief be those capable of obtain the remedy designate when a agency thus resolve statutory tension ordinary principle of administrative deference require we to defer see national of home builders defender of wildlife when a statutory scheme contain a fundamental ambiguity arise from the differ mandate of two provision it be appropriate to look to the implement agency expert interpretation to determine which must give way iii the respondent urge we to overturn the board judgment for three independent reason first and principally they take issue with the board and now we view of the limit associate with automatic conversion they argue that every beneficiary petition can automatically be convert to a appropriate category and that the two half of h be thus reconcilable second the respondent contend that even if automatic conversion do not extend so far h separately entitle each such beneficiary to the benefit of he original petition priority date and third they claim that the board way of resolve whatever ambiguity inhere in h be arbitrary and capricious the dissent opinion reiterate the first two argument though with slight variation and in opposite order while forgo the third see post at opinion of sotomayor hereinafter the dissent we find none of the contention persuasive a the respondent and the dissent initially aver that every beneficiary include they own son and daughter can automatically be convert to a appropriate immigration category if only immigration official try hard enough the government in the respondent view can accomplish that feat by substitute new sponsor for old one and by manage the timing of every conversion to ensure such a new petitioner exist on the relevant date brief for respondent and because the respondent say it be thus possible to align the two half of h even if through multiple administrative maneuver immigration official be under a obligation to do so we disagree for reason that should sound familiar several be the same as those we have just give for uphold the board interpretation but still we walk through the respondent argument to show how far it depart from any ordinary understanding of automatic conversion the first and necessary premise of that argument do not augur well for the remainder it be the view that the automatic conversion procedure permit a change in the petitioner identity accord to the respondent the beneficiary parent upon become lpr can be sub in for the original sponsor the beneficiary grandparent aunt and uncle and the petition then convert to the category but as we have show the automatic conversion language as most naturally read and as long use throughout immigration law contemplate merely move a petition into a new and valid category not change its most essential feature see supra at that alone defeat the respondent position and a further problem follow this one concern the date of automatic conversion the respondent need that date to come at a time when the derivative beneficiary parent the substitute petitioner be already live in the united states as lpr otherwise the petition could not qualify for the box in a attempt to make that possible the respondent propose that conversion be view as take place when the derivative beneficiary visa application be adjudicate brief for respondent but as we have again demonstrate the statute be best read as establish a different date that on which a immigrant visa number become available for the alien parent when by definition the parent be not yet a lpr h see supra at that be the moment when a derivative age out which be the single change conversion reflect by contrast the respondent suggest date have no connection to that metamorphosis the date of adjudication be merely when a immigration official later discover that a child have turn and that date be itself fortuitous reflect no more than when a immigration officer get around to review a visa application the possibility of conversion would thus depend on bureaucratic vagary attend the visa process so the respondent mistaken view of the timing of conversion be another from they argument yet there be more because even after substitute a new petitioner and delay the conversion date in a way the statute do not contemplate the respondent must propose yet further fix to make automatic conversion work for they son and daughter the respondent next problem be that even on the conversion date they propose most of they and other derivative parent be not yet lpr and so could not possibly be sponsor in the ordinary course principal and derivative beneficiary live abroad apply for they visa at the same time and go to the consulate together for interview see supra at and even if the parent be approve first that alone do not make she a lpr she still must come to this country demonstrate she continued eligibility and pass a inspection see ibid thus the respondent must recommend change to the visa process to get the timing to work essentially administrative juggling to hold off the derivative beneficiary visa adjudication until he parent have become a lpr in particular they suggest that the consular official defer the derivative interview or that the official nominally reject the application and then instruct the derivative to reapply after the principal beneficiary immigrate brief for respondent but the need for that choreography which in any event few if any of the respondent conform to render the conversion process only less automatic because now it require special intervention purposeful delay and deviation from standard administrative practice conversion have become not a machine that would go of itself but a process painstakingly manage and after all this fancy footwork the respondent scheme still can not succeed because however long a visa adjudication be postpone a derivative parent may never become able to sponsor a relative visa and immigration official can not practicably tell whether a give parent have do so we have note before the potential impediment to serve as a petitioner include that a parent may not immigrate may not qualify as a sponsor or may not be able to provide the requisite financial support see supra at the respondent offer no way to deal with those many contingency require the parent to submit a new petition but the entire point of automatic conversion as the respondent themselves agree be to obviate the need for such a document see brief for respondent investigate the parent eligibility in some other way but even be that possible which we doubt such a inquiry would not square with the essential idea of a automatic process disregard the possibility that no legal sponsor exist but then visa would go inevitably and not infrequently to ineligible alien and so the workaround have well and truly run out on the respondent argument that leave we with the same statutory inconsistency with which we begin have follow each step of the respondent resourceful if rube goldbergish argument we still see no way to apply the concept of automatic conversion to the respondent child and other like they and that mean we continue to face a statute whose half do not correspond to each other give rise to a ambiguity that call for chevron deference b the respondent however have another idea for reconcile h front and back part and this claim become the dissent principal argument recall that the section remedial clause instruct that the alien petition shall automatically be convert to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issue upon receipt of the original petition the respondent and the dissent ask we to read the italicized language as confer a benefit wholly independent of automatic conversion on that view derivative even though ineligible for conversion could retain the ir original priority date s if they parent file a new petition as the respondent in fact do here as a protective matter tr of oral arg and then everyone encompass in h first clause would get at least some form of relief even if not both form from the section second for this argument the respondent principally rely on the word and where the word and connect two phrase as in h back half the respondent contend those term operate independently brief for respondent see post at but the conjunction and do not necessarily disjoin two phrase in the way the respondent say in some sentence no doubt the respondent have a point they use as they primary example i f the boat take on water then you shall operate the bilge pump and you shall distribute life jacket brief for respondent see also post at offering further example we agree that you shall distribute life jacket function in that sentence as a independent command but we can come up with many paired dictate in which the second be conditional on the first if the price be reasonable buy two ticket and save a receipt if you have time this summer read this book and give i a report or shades of this case if you contract expire buy a new phone and keep the old number in each case the second command function only once the first be accomplish whether and work in that way or in the respondent depend like many question of usage on the context see caraco pharmaceutical laboratories novo nordisk here we think context compel the board view that the instruction work in tandem the first phrase instruct immigration official to convert a petition when a appropriate category exist the next clarify that such a convert petition will retain the original priority date rather than receive a new one correspond to the date of conversion that reading comport with the way retention figure in other statutory and regulatory provision respect conversion there too retention of a priority date be conditional on a conversion occur see k cfr i supra at the respondent wish to unhook the retention phrase from that mooring and use it to explain what will attend a different event that be the filing of a new petition but that be to make retention conditional on something the statute nowhere mention a highly improbable thing for congress to have do if once again a teacher say to read this book and give i a report no one would think he want a report on some unidentified subject and indeed the respondent and dissent own example prove this point in not a single one of they proffer sentence be the second command contingent on the occurrence of some additional unstated event as it would have to be under the respondent construction of h rather each such command distribute life jacket flow directly from the state condition if the boat take on water so by far the more natural understanding of h text be that retention follow conversion and nothing else the respondent contrary view would also engender unusual result introduce uncertainty into the immigration system operation and thus interfere with statutory goal be they theory correct a alien could hold on to a priority date for year or even decade while wait for a relative to file a new petition even if that filing happen say year after the alien age out the alien could take out he token and assert a right to spring to the front of any visa line at that point uscis could well have a hard time confirm the old priority date in part because the name of derivative beneficiary need not be list on a visa petition and the possibility of such from many year past would impede uscis publication of accurate wait time as far as we know immigration law nowhere else allow a alien to keep in he pocket a priority date untether to any exist valid petition without some clearer statement we can not conclude congress intend here to create such a entitlement to a defunct petition priority date see wang at c finally the respondent contend that even if h point at once in two direction toward a broader scope in its first half and a narrower one in its second the bia act unreasonably in choose the more restrictive reading in they view the board have offer no valid reason consistent with the purpose and concern of the immigration law to treat they own son and daughter less favorably than alien who be principal and derivative beneficiary of petition brief for respondent indeed the respondent suggest that the bia for its own unfathomable reason disapprove of congress decision to allow any alien to get relief and have thus limited h to as few derivative beneficiary as possible at we can not agree at the least the board interpretation have administrative simplicity to recommend it under that view immigration authority need only perform the kind of straightforward automatic conversion they have do for decade move a petition from one box to another to reflect a give status change like age out see wang at the respondent as we have show would transform conversion into a manage process require immigration and consular official around the world to sequence and delay every alien visa adjudication until they be able to confirm that one of he parent have become a qualify and willing petitioner and accord to the government incomplete statistics that would have to happen in at a minimum ten of thousand of case every year see reply brief still more important the board offer a cogent argument reflect statutory purpose for distinguish between beneficiary of petition and the respondent son and daughter see wang at as earlier explain the beneficiary have all have a qualify relationship with a lpr for the entire period they have wait in line since they original priority date see supra at that mean that when immigration authority convert they petition they will enter the line at the same place as other who have have a comparable relationship for a equal time the conversion thus fit with the immigration law basic rule see e supra at by contrast the derivative beneficiary of and petition like the respondent son and daughter lack any qualify relationship with a citizen or lpr during the period they wait in line see supra at they be instead the grandchild niece or nephew of citizen and those relationship do not independently entitle they to visa if such alien receive relief under h they would jump over thousand of other in the line who have a qualify relationship with a lpr for a far longer time that displacement would the board reasonably find scramble the priority order congress prescribe the argument to the contrary assume that the respondent son and daughter should receive credit for all the time the respondent themselves stand in line brief for respondent but first the time the respondent spend wait for a visa may diverge substantially from the time they child do suppose for example that one of the respondent have stand in the queue for year and with just year to go marry someone with a son under the respondent reading that derivative beneficiary after age out would get the full benefit of he new parent wait and so displace many thousand of alien who unlike he have stand in a immigration queue for nearly two decade and second even when the derivative qualify as such for all the time he parent stand in line he status throughout that period hinge on he be that parent minor child if he parent have obtain a visa before he age out he would have be eligible for a visa too because the law do not demand that a prospective immigrant abandon a minor child but if the parent have die while wait for a visa or have be find ineligible or have decide not to immigrate after all the derivative would have get nothing for the time spend in line see supra at similarly the board could reasonably conclude he should not receive credit for he parent wait when he have become old enough to live independently in the unavoidably world of allocate a limited number of visa the board could decide that he belong behind any alien who have have a lengthier entitlement to immigrate iv this be the kind of case chevron be build for whatever congress might have mean in enact h it fail to speak clearly confront with a ambiguous provision in a complex statutory scheme the board choose a textually reasonable construction consonant with its view of the purpose and policy underlie immigration law be we to overturn the board in that circumstance we would assume as we own the responsible and expert agency role we decline that path and defer to the board we therefore reverse the judgment of the ninth circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion it be so order roberts concur in judgment lori scialabba acting director united state citizenship and immigration service et petitioners rosalina cuellar de osorio et on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the ninth circuit june chief justice roberts with whom justice scalia join concur in the judgment i agree with much of the plurality opinion and with its conclusion that the board of immigration appeals reasonably interpret h i write separately because i take a different view of what make this provision ambiguous under chevron natural resources defense council as the plurality read section h the statute two clause address the issue before the court in divergent way and do not easily cohere with each other ante at for the plurality the first clause look toward the sweeping relief the respondent propose which would reach every beneficiary of a family preference petition while the second clause offer narrower relief that can help only a subset of those beneficiary ibid such clause the plurality say leave the board with a choice essentially of how to reconcile the statute different command ante at to the extent the plurality opinion could be read to suggest that deference be warrant because of a direct conflict between these clause that be wrong court defer to a agency reasonable construction of a ambiguous statute because we presume that congress intend to assign responsibility to resolve the ambiguity to the agency chevron supra at but when congress assign to a agency the responsibility for decide whether a particular group should get relief it do not do so by simultaneously say that the group should and that it should not direct conflict be not ambiguity and the resolution of such a conflict be not statutory construction but legislative choice chevron be not a license for a agency to repair a statute that do not make sense i see no conflict or even internal tension ante at in section h see fda brown williamson tobacco we must interpret the statute as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme and fit if possible all part into a harmonious whole citation omit the statute read if the age of a alien be determine under section h to be year of age or older for the purpose of subsection a a and d of this section the alien petition shall automatically be convert to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issue upon receipt of the original petition h the first clause state a condition one that beneficiary from any preference category can meet and thereby define the person potentially affect by this provision but the clause do not grant anything to anyone i disagree with the plurality that the first clause point toward relief ante at because i do not think the first clause point toward any relief at all imagine a provision of the tax code that read if a student be determine to be enrol at a accredit university the student cost of housing shall be deductible on she tax return it would be immediately apparent from that provision that a enrol student who live on campus be not entitle to the deduction even though the student fall within the conditional first clause and yet no one would describe the two clause as be in tension if the internal revenue service then interpret the term cost of housing to exclude payment by a student who rent a home from he parent a court would determine whether that interpretation be reasonable the same be true in this case the particular benefit provide by section h be find exclusively in the second clause the only operative provision there we be tell what a beneficiary from whatever preference category be entitle to he petition shall automatically be convert to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date h but automatic conversion be not possible for every beneficiary in every preference category as the plurality convincingly demonstrate ante at automatic conversion require at minimum that the beneficiary have he own sponsor who demonstrate that he be eligible to act as a sponsor and who commit to provide financial support for the beneficiary ante at some child will not meet those prerequisite and they can not benefit from automatic conversion even under respondent interpretation of the statute beyond those requirement however congress do not speak clearly to which petition can automatically be convert h whatever other interpretation of that provision might be possible it be reasonable for the reason explain by the plurality for the board to interpret section h to provide relief only to a child who be a principal or derivative beneficiary of a petition that interpretation be consistent with the ordinary meaning of the statutory term with the established meaning of automatic conversion in immigration law and with the structure of the immigration system ante at it also avoid the problem that would flow from respondent propose alternative interpretation include the suggestion that retention of the original priority date provide a benefit wholly separate from automatic conversion ante at i concur in the judgment alito dissent lori scialabba acting director united state citizenship and immigration service et petitioners rosalina cuellar de osorio et on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the ninth circuit june justice alito dissent i agree with many of justice sotomayor criticism of the plurality opinion i also agree with the chief justice critique of the plurality suggestion that when two half of a statute do not easily cohere with each other a agency administer the statute be free to decide which half it will obey ante at after all d irect conflict be not ambiguity and the resolution of such conflict be not statutory construction but legislative choice ante at roberts concur in judgment while i like justice sotomayor would affirm the court of appeals my justification for do so differ somewhat from hers as i see it the question before we be whether there be or be not a appropriate category to which the petition for respondent child may be convert if there be the agency be obligate by the clear text of h to convert the petition and leave the child with they original priority date any such conversion would be automatic because the agency obligation to convert the petition follow inexorably and without need for any additional action on the part of either respondent or they child from the fact that the child age have be calculate to be or older if there be not a appropriate category then the agency be not require to convert the petition by the time respondent become legal permanent resident and file new petition for they child if not sooner there exist a appropriate category to which the original petition could be convert that be because at that point the child all qualify for preference status as unmarried adult child of legal permanent resident accordingly the agency should have convert respondent child petition and allow they to retain they original priority date section h be brief and cryptic it may well contain a great deal of ambiguity which the board of immigration appeals in its expertise be free to resolve so long as its resolution be a permissible construction of the statute chevron natural resources defense council but the statute be clear on at least one point if the age of a alien be determine under h to be year of age or older the alien petition shall automatically be convert to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issue upon receipt of the original petition emphasis add the board be not free to disregard this clear statutory command sotomayor dissent lori scialabba acting director united state citizenship and immigration service et petitioners rosalina cuellar de osorio et on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the ninth circuit june justice sotomayor with whom justice breyer join and with whom justice thomas join except as to footnote dissent although the workings of we nation immigration system be often complex the narrow question of statutory interpretation at the heart of this case be straightforward which child be entitle to retain they priority date derivative beneficiary of visa petition in all five category or derivative beneficiary of petition in only one category the initial clause of h provide a clear answer child may retain they priority date so long as they meet a single condition they must be determine to be year of age or older for purpose of derivative beneficiary status because all five category of child satisfy this condition all be entitle to relief notwithstanding this textual command the board of immigration appeals bia rule that four of the five category of child to whom h unambiguously promise priority date retention be in fact entitle to no relief at all see matter of wang the court defer to that interpretation today in do so the court do not identify any ambiguity in the dispositive initial clause of h indeed it candidly admit that the clause mandate relief for every beneficiary of a petition in any of the five category ante at the court nevertheless hold that the bia be free to ignore this unambiguous text on the ground that h also offer derivative beneficiary a type of relief automatic conversion that it think can apply only to one of the five category the court thus perceive a conflict in the statute that in its view permit the bia to override h initial eligibility clause in reach this conclusion the court fail to follow a cardinal rule of statutory interpretation when decide whether congress have specifically address the question at issue thereby leave no room for a agency to fill a statutory gap court must interpret the statute as a coherent regulatory scheme and fit if possible all part into a harmonious whole fda brown williamson tobacco citation omit because the court and the bia ignore obvious way in which h can operate as a coherent whole and instead construe the statute as a that be break from the moment congress write it i respectfully dissent i under chevron the first question we ask when review a agency construction of a statute be whether congress have directly speak to the precise question at issue chevron natural resources defense council if it have then the court as well as the agency must give effect to th at unambiguously express intent at congress have speak directly to the question in this case united states citizen and lawful permanent resident lpr may petition for certain relative who reside abroad know as the principal beneficiary of such petition to receive immigrant visa congress have define five category of eligible relative refer to as category with annual limit on the number of visa that may be issue within each category because the demand for visa outstrip supply the wait for a visa can often last many year while a principal beneficiary wait she place in line be determine base on she priority date the date on which she petition be file see e cfr b cfr a priority date be therefore crucial the earlier one priority date the sooner one place will come up in line and a visa will be available significantly when the wait end and a principal beneficiary finally become eligible to apply for a visa d enable the beneficiary spouse and minor child know as derivative beneficiary to do so too this case arise from a common problem give the lengthy period prospective immigrant must wait for a visa a principal beneficiary child although younger than when she parent petition be initially file often will have turn by the time the parent priority date come up in line such a child be say to have age out of derivative beneficiary treatment under d by way of example respondent norma uy be the principal beneficiary of a petition file by she citizen sister in february that petition list norma daughter ruth who be then two year old as a derivative beneficiary if norma have reach the front of the visa line at any time before ruth birthday d would have enable ruth to accompany norma to the united states unfortunately it take more than two decade for norma priority date to become current by which point ruth be and thus too old for derivative beneficiary status under d norma therefore immigrate alone to the united states where she file a new petition for unmarried child of lpr on ruth behalf before h be enact however a immigrant in ruth position would have be unable to retain the february priority date from she original petition the law would have instead require she to receive a new priority date all the way at the back of the line congress respond to this problem by enact h a provision entitle r etention of priority date it state if the age of a alien be determine under the formula specify in paragraph to be year of age or older for the purpos e of d of this section the alien petition shall automatically be convert to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issue upon receipt of the original petition the provision structure be crucial to its meaning the initial clause call it the eligibility clause specify who be eligible for relief the conclude clause call it the relief clause describe the two form of relief to which eligible person be entitle as the title of the provision suggest the main form of relief be the right of a derivative beneficiary to retain the priority date of she original petition in ruth uy case such relief would mean the difference between resume she wait near the front of the line which would allow she to receive a visa in short order and be send to the back of the line where she would potentially have to wait a additional year brief for respondent the question in this case be which beneficiary of petition be eligible for priority date retention the beneficiary of petition in all five category which would include respondent child who be derivative beneficiary of and petition for adult child and adult sibling of citizen respectively or the beneficiary of only petition for spouse and child of lpr the interpretation offer by the bia congress answer that question in h eligibility clause which specify that relief be to be confer on any immigrant who have be determine under the formula specify in paragraph to be year of age or older for the purpose of d as the plurality concede this clause state a condition that every beneficiary of a preference petition satisfy that be it make eligible for relief child within each of the and category ante at congress make this clear in two mutually reinforce way first by refer to the formula set forth in paragraph the statute incorporate that paragraph to h section h in turn define the set of covered petition to include with respect to a alien child who be a derivative beneficiary under d a petition file for classification of the alien parent under a and a encompass all five category see a second h promise relief to those who be find to be for the purpos e of d the provision govern derivative beneficiary and that provision also unambiguously cover all five category see d a minor child be entitle to the same status as a parent who be the principal beneficiary of a petition file under a a set forth the five category in short h eligibility clause answer the precise question in this case beneficiary within all five category be entitle to relief t he intent of congress be clear so that be the end of the matter chevron at ii a because it concede that h eligibility clause unambiguously encompass every beneficiary of a petition ante at the plurality try to fit this case into a special pocket of chevron jurisprudence in which it say we must defer to a agency decision to ignore a clear statutory command due to a conflict between that command and another statutory provision see ante at thus unlike in the usual chevron case where ambiguity derive from the fact that the text do not speak with sufficient specificity to the question at issue the plurality argue that this be a case in which ambiguity can only arise if it be to arise at all if congress have speak clearly on the issue in diametrically oppose way as the plurality frame it h eligibility and relief clause be and that conflict make possible alternative reasonable construction ante at in rush to find a conflict within the statute the plurality neglect a fundamental tenet of statutory interpretation we do not lightly presume that congress have legislate in term see scalia garner reading law the interpretation of legal text the provision of a text should be interpret in a way that render they compatible not contradictory t here can be no justification for needlessly render provision in conflict if they can be interpret harmoniously that be especially true where as here the conflict that congress supposedly create be not between two different statute or even two separate provision within a single statute but between two clause in the same sentence see ibid i t be invariably true that intelligent drafter do not contradict themselves thus time and again we have stress we duty to fit if possible all part of a statute into a harmonious whole ftc mandel brothers see also morton mancari when two provision be capable of it be the duty of the court to regard each as effective in review a agency construction of a statute court must we have emphasize interpret the statute as a coherent regulatory scheme rather than a internally inconsistent muddle at war with itself and defective from the day it be write brown williamson at and in do so court should e mplo y traditional tool of statutory construction ins each of these caution spring from a common well as judicious as it can be to defer to administrative agency we foremost duty be and always have be to give effect to the law as draft by congress the plurality contend that deference be appropriate here because in its view h two clause be ante at but far from it be unworkable or even difficult for the agency to obey both clause traditional tool of statutory construction reveal that h clause be entirely compatible b the plurality argue that although h eligibility clause clearly encompass beneficiary within all five preference category the relief clause imply a conflict limitation on the eligible class of recipient ante at the plurality infer that limitation from two premise first it contend that no child may retain she priority date unless she petition be also eligible for automatic conversion and second it assert that only beneficiary may receive automatic conversion as a result the plurality conclude it be reasonable for the bia to exclude child in the four other category from receive both automatic conversion and priority date retention thereby render h eligibility clause defunct the plurality conclusion be wrong because its premise be wrong for one h be naturally read to confer priority date retention as a independent form of relief to all child regardless of whether automatic conversion be separately available and even if that be wrong the plurality supposition that only beneficiary can receive automatic conversion be incorrect on its own term because either of these interpretation would treat h as a coherent whole the bia construction be impermissible the most obvious flaw in the plurality analysis be its presumption that h permit a child to retain she original priority date only if she petition can be automatically convert that be incorrect for many reason when a immigrant be determine to have age out of derivative beneficiary status h prescribe two form of relief t he alien petition shall automatically be convert to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issue upon receipt of the original petition we have hold that when a statute provide two form of relief in this manner join by the conjunction and the two remedy be distinct united states ron pair enterprises that understanding make particular sense here where congress use the mandatory word shall twice once before each form of relief see lexecon milberg weiss bershad hynes lerach t he mandatory term shall normally create a obligation impervious to judicial discretion moreover the two shall command operate on different subject further reinforce that they prescribe distinct remedy a alien petition shall automatically be convert but it be the alien herself who in all event shall retain she original priority date h emphasis add the plurality respond with a series of example in which the word and be use to join two command one of which be as the plurality assert here dependent on another ante at and but as the plurality recognize ante at that be hardly the only way the word can be use for example if today baseball game be rain out you ticket shall automatically be convert to a ticket for next saturday game and you shall retain you free souvenir from today game or if you provide the dmv with proof of you new address you voter registration shall automatically be convert to the correct polling location and you shall receive in the mail a update driver license it be plain in both of these example that the two command be distinct the fan in the first example can keep she free souvenir even if she can not attend next saturday game the new resident will receive a update driver license even if she be ineligible to vote what the plurality do not explain be why we should forgo the same understanding of h relief clause when that would treat the statute as a coherent whole and when the plurality alternative interpretation would render the statute a walk within the span of a few word with the text unavailing the plurality turn to a policy argument the plurality worry that if automatic conversion and priority date retention be independent benefit beneficiary will be able to hold on to a priority date for year while wait for a relative to file a new petition which might hamper citizenship and immigration services uscis operation ante at but the plurality fear of administrative inconvenience be belie by the fact that uscis have administer priority date retention in exactly this manner for year with no apparent problem well before h be enact a regulation provide derivative beneficiary the ability to retain they priority date without also provide automatic conversion see cfr a permit priority date retention after a separate petition be file fed reg adopt this provision indeed the uscis continue to instruct field officer that a separate petition must be file in order for such beneficiary to retain they original priority date s adjudicator field manual ch c online at all internet material as visit june and available in clerk of court case file the notion that it be somehow impossible for a immigrant to retain she priority date contingent upon the filing of a separate petition be therefore contradict by year of agency experience in the end the plurality suggest that we should defer to the bia approach because context compel it ante at yet fatally absent from the plurality discussion of context be any mention of the first clause of the very same provision which as the plurality admit unambiguously confer relief upon all five category of child that clause be dispositive because assume that beneficiary alone can receive automatic conversion a reading that treat automatic conversion and priority date retention as independent benefit be the only one that would produc e a substantive effect that be compatible with the rest of the law united sav of timbers of inwood forest associates see also home builders at it be a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the word of a statute must be read in they context and with a view to they place in the overall statutory scheme even if it be somehow impossible for a child to retain she priority date independently of automatic conversion the plurality be wrong to view automatic conversion as a benefit that beneficiary alone may enjoy section h provide that if a child qualify for relief under the statute eligibility clause the alien petition shall automatically be convert to the appropriate category whether a beneficiary in a give preference category may enjoy this relief turn on how one understand the word automatically and convert because the statute do not define the term we apply they ordinary meaning see burrage united states slip at the ordinary meaning of automatic be have the capability of start operate move independently base upon some predetermined predicate event with no additional decision contingency or delay ante at quote random house webster unabridged dictionary ed the ordinary meaning of convert be to change something into a different form at here the statute specify the form into which a child petition shall be change another petition in the appropriate category h tie the term together then automatic conversion means change a old petition into a new petition in a appropriate category upon the occurrence of some predicate event without a further decision or contingency all beneficiary can have they petition automatically convert under this definition perhaps most sensibly all five category of petition may be convert to a appropriate category without any further decision or contingency upon a logical predicate event when uscis receive confirmation that a appropriate category exist to see how this would work recall the case of norma uy and she daughter ruth norma be the principal beneficiary of a petition file by she citizen sister ruth be a derivative beneficiary of the same petition because ruth have age out of derivative beneficiary status prior to norma reach the front of the visa line norma immigrate to the united states without ruth once norma become a lpr however she also become eligible to file a new petition on ruth behalf under the category unmarried adult child of lpr a b thus once norma provide confirmation of that eligibility to sponsor ruth that she be a lpr that ruth be she daughter and that she have not commit disqualify criminal conduct see ante at ruth original petition can automatically be convert to a petition with no additional decision or contingency indeed this be how uscis already apply automatic conversion in other context for example when a lpr have file a petition on behalf of a spouse or child and the lpr subsequently become a citizen a provision entitle a utomatic conversion of preference classification cfr i permit the petition to be automatically convert to a immediate relative petition i see ante at significantly the predicate event that trigger this conversion be the agency receipt of proof that the petition sponsor have become a citizen proof in other word that there be a appropriate category into which the petition can be convert section h automatic conversion remedy can sensibly be administer in the same way the plurality contrary conclusion that automatic conversion be impossible for all but one category of petition hinge on three basic misunderstanding first the plurality contend that automatic conversion be trigger not by confirmation of the existence of a appropriate category but rather by a different predicate event the moment when a immigrant visa number bec ome available for the alien parent ante at this be a curious argument not least because nothing in h suggest it that provision simply make automatic conversion available i f the age of a alien be determine to be be year of age or older for purpose of d section h thus state the condition that a immigrant must satisfy to be eligible for automatic conversion but it nowhere command when the conversion should occur there be no reason why conversion can not occur at the logical point just describe the moment when uscis receive proof that a appropriate category exist the plurality acknowledge that h do not explicitly identify th e point in time at which a petition be to be convert ante at it nevertheless suggest that the date when a conversion occur be best view as the date when a visa become available for the child parent ante at but congress could not have intend conversion to occur at that point for a glaring reason the date on which a visa become available for a child parent occur before the point at which the child be determine to have under d the very requirement h prescribe for the child to be eligible for automatic conversion in the first place as the plurality explain ante at such age determination occur when a immigration official review the child derivative visa application which invariably happen after a visa become available for the child parent as the principal beneficiary at best then the plurality interpretation require uscis to convert petition at a time when it do not know which petition be eligible for conversion at worst it require the automatic conversion of petition benefit immigrant who will never even qualify for such relief immigrant who for any number of reason never file a visa application and so be never determine by official to be older than face with this fact the plurality fall back to the position that automatic conversion must merely be view as have occur as of th e date when a parent visa become available although the actual assess ment of the conversion will necessarily occur at some future point in time ante at that approach however introduce precisely the kind of additional decision contingency and delay that the plurality regard as inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of automatic ante at for even under the plurality view automatic conversion can not actually be assesse d until and unless the child decide to apply for a visa and official assess the child application deem she to have age out event which may themselves be contingent on the child parent first file she own successful visa application see ante at the far simpler approach be for conversion to occur automatically upon the most logical moment suggest by the statute the moment when uscis confirm that a appropriate category exist h indeed the plurality fail to explain why this can not be the proper predicate it simply dismiss such a approach as support only by a resolve to grant relief to every possible beneficiary ante at but that criticism be reveal the resolve the plurality malign be congress own for it be congress that expressly provide in the eligibility clause for beneficiary in all five category to be grant relief the plurality second argument be a corollary of its first if automatic conversion must occur when a visa first become available for a parent the plurality fret that will mean a child will have she petition automatically convert before immigration official can ascertain whether she parent be even qualify to sponsor she see ante at true enough but that only confirm that it make no sense to force uscis to convert petition so prematurely the plurality fear can all be avert by have automatic conversion occur as with petition sponsor by lpr who later become citizen supra at when uscis receive confirmation that conversion be appropriate the plurality final argument be that something about the term conversion preclude relief for all but the derivative beneficiary of petition the plurality accept that conversion will always require change some aspect of a petition include its preference category from to and the identity of its principal beneficiary from a child parent to the child but the plurality assert that a related kind of change be entirely off the table a change to the identity of the petition sponsor ante at if a convert petition require a different sponsor than the original petition the plurality suggest then it can not be convert at all the plurality point to nothing in the plain meaning of conversion that support this distinction it instead argue that a conversion can not entail a change to the identity of a petition sponsor because that be the exclusive way immigration law use the term when congress enact the cspa ante at but immigration law have long allow petition to be convert from one category to another in context where do so require change the sponsor identity in for example the secretary of homeland security promulgate a regulatory provision entitle automatic conversion of preference classification cfr i iv which allow the automatic conversion of a petition file by a citizen on behalf of she spouse to a widower petition if the citizen die before the petition be approve that conversion require change the sponsor from the citizen to the widower himself the fact that the agency use the word conversion to refer to a process in which the petition sponsor be change just a few year after h be enact strongly suggest that the term do not have the exclusive meaning that the plurality suggest similarly a d i iii a provision enact two year before h see victim of trafficking and violence protection act of stat provide that a petition file by a battered spouse on behalf of she child shall be consider a file by the child herself if the child age out a conversion that obviously require change the identity of the sponsor from the battered spouse to the child and h confirm that such be entitle to h automatic conversion remedy the plurality never explain how it can be mandatory to convert the identity of the sponsor in these context yet impermissible to convert the sponsor of the petition at issue here a understanding that be especially implausible in light of congress command that such petition shall automatically be convert to the appropriate category h iii the concurrence reach the same result as the plurality do but for a different reason it begin by recognize that h eligibility clause state a condition that be satisfy by beneficiary from any preference category ante at roberts concur in judgment the concurrence thus acknowledge that the eligibility clause encompass beneficiary of petition in the and category the concurrence nonetheless conclude that the bia be free to exclude and beneficiary from the clear scope of the eligibility clause because of a perceive ambiguity as to which beneficiary can receive automatic conversion see ante at congress do not speak clearly to which petition can automatically be convert in other word the concurrence conclude that it be reasonable for the agency to ignore the clear text of the eligibility clause because the phrase automatic conversion might be read in a manner that would benefit beneficiary alone this be a unusual way to interpret a statute the concurrence identify no case in which we have defer to a agency decision to use ambiguity in one portion of a statute as a license to ignore another statutory provision that be perfectly clear to the contrary a provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation be often clarify by the remainder of the statutory scheme because only one of the permissible meaning produce a substantive effect that be compatible with the rest of the law united sav of at the concurrence justify its conclusion only by treat the eligibility clause as a nullity the concurrence be quite candid about its approach argue that h relief clause be its only operative provision and that the eligibility clause do not grant anything to anyone ante at yet i t be we duty to give effect if possible to every clause and word of a statute united states menasche and there be a easy way to give mean to the eligibility clause the clause identify who be entitle to the benefit specify in the ensue relief clause the concurrence rely ultimately on a irrelevant hypothetical if a student be determine to be enrol at a accredit university the student cost of housing shall be deductible on she tax return ante at in this example the concurrence point out it be apparent that a enrol student who live on campus be not entitle to the deduction even though the student fall within the conditional first clause ibid that be correct but it say nothing about this case for in the hypothetical it be plain that the promise relief a tax deduction for housing can not apply to the person at issue student who live on campus here however the relief promise in h priority date retention and automatic conversion can be give to person specify in the initial eligibility clause child in all five category see supra at and once one recognize that child in each category unambiguously cover by the eligibility clause can receive relief the bia view that no child in four of those category can ever receive any relief can not be reasonable congress face a difficult choice when it enact h give the world of allocate a limited number of visa ante at congress could have require child like ruth uy to lose they place in line and wait many additional year or even decade before be reunite with they parent or it could have enable such immigrant to retain they place in line albeit at the cost of extend the wait for other immigrant by some shorter amount whatever one might think of the policy argument on each side however this much be clear congress make a choice the plurality contrary view that congress actually delegate the choice to the bia in a statute that unambiguously encompass child in all five preference category and command that they shall retain the ir original priority date s h be untenable in the end then this case should have be resolve under a commonsense approach to statutory interpretation use traditional tool of statutory construction agency and court should try to give effect to a statute clear text before conclude that congress have legislate in conflict and unintelligible term here there be straightforward interpretation of h that allow it to function as a coherent whole because the bia and the court ignore these interpretation and advance a construction that contravene the language congress write i respectfully dissent footnote footnote a alien already in the united states for example on a student or temporary worker visa must obtain adjustment of status rather than a immigrant visa to become a lawful permanent resident see a because the criterion for secure adjustment of status and obtain a immigrant visa be materially identical we use the single term immigrant visa to refer to both footnote the family preference label as use by immigration official apply only to these five classification and not to the category for immediate relative of citizen see brief for petitioner footnote immigrant visa can also go to alien with special marketable skill see a b or to alien from

the united states who have apply for adjustment of status see supra the immigration officer interview such a alien upon find she may declare she a lpr on the spot see i but here too the officer will not make a derivative beneficiary a lpr unless and until he approve that status for the principal see cfr a footnote see uscis processing time information online at http do footnote see the immigrant visa process interview online at footnote the full text of these three paragraph for the masochist among this opinion reader be as follow h rule for determine whether certain alien be child in general for purpose of subsection a a and d of this section a determination of whether a alien satisfy the age requirement in the matter precede subparagraph a of section b of this title shall be make use a the age of the alien on the date on which a immigrant visa number become available for such alien or in the case of subsection d of this section the date on which a immigrant visa number become available for the alien parent but only if the alien have seek to acquire the status of a alien lawfully admit for permanent residence within one year of such availability reduce by b the number of day in the period during which the applicable petition describe in paragraph be pend petition describe the petition describe in this paragraph be a with respect to a relationship describe in subsection a a of this section a petition file under section of this title for classification of a alien child under subsection a a of this section or b with respect to a alien child who be a derivative beneficiary under subsection d of this section a petition file under section of this title for classification of the alien parent under subsection a b or c of this section retention of priority date if the age of a alien be determine under paragraph to be year of age or older for the purpose of subsection a a and d of this section the alien petition shall automatically be convert to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issue upon receipt of the original petition h footnote compare case below hold that h extend relief to all derivative beneficiary khalid holder same with li renaud hold that h not merely permit but require the board contrary interpretation footnote the dissent respond to this fact only with a pair of post at opinion of sotomayor first the dissent cite a statutory provision that do not use the word conversion at all so can hardly attest to its meaning see a d i iii and next the dissent cite a regulation that the cspa by year and thus be equally irrelevant to what congress intend see fed reg add cfr i iv moreover both provision relate to a sui generis circumstance in which a person can for a visa because she citizen or lpr relative either die or engage in domestic abuse in that situation the alien eligibility rest throughout on she connection to the deceased or abusive relative no new party must ever come in as one have to in a case like wang to salvage a petition see infra at address the problem that the substitution of a new petitioner raise footnote give the statute broad definition of child the only derivative beneficiary who fall outside that proviso be stepchildren who be over the age of when the petitioner marry the spousal beneficiary see b b the government represent that thousand of child be designate as derivative every year see reply brief footnote it be therefore impossible to understand the dissent statement that conversion of such a petition to a appropriate category require substantive alteration to the petition see post at opinion of sotomayor footnote still the respondent view of the timing of conversion be better than the dissent as a initial matter the dissent objection to assess conversion as of the date a visa become available hinge on a imaginary difficulty that approach the dissent complain can not be right because that date always occur before the point at which the child be determine to have post at well yes the date a visa become available be under the statute the date a alien age out or not and that status change of course occur before a immigration official review a visa application find that it have do so but what of it when a official determine th
