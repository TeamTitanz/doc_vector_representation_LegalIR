the clean water act regulate the discharge of any pollutant into the water of the united states a when property contain such water landowner who discharge pollutant without a permit from the army corps of engineers risk substantial criminal and civil penalty c d while those who do apply for a permit face a process that be often arduous expensive and long it can be difficult to determine in the first place however whether water of the united states be present during the time period relevant to this case for example the corps define that term to include all wetland the use degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate or foreign commerce cfr a because of that difficulty the corps allow property owner to obtain a standalone jurisdictional determination jd specify whether a particular property contain water of the united states a jd may be either preliminary advise a property owner that such water may be present or approve definitively state the presence or absence of such water ibid a approve jd be consider a administratively appealable final agency action a and be bind for five year on both the corps and the environmental protection agency cfr pt app c epa memorandum of agreement exemption under section f of the clean water act respondent three company engage in mining peat seek a permit from the corps to discharge material onto wetland locate on

wetland have a significant nexus to the red river of the north located some mile away after exhaust administrative remedy respondent seek review of the approve jd in federal district court under the administrative procedure act apa but the district court dismiss for want of jurisdiction hold that the revise jd be not a final agency action for which there be no other adequate remedy in a court the eighth circuit reverse hold the corps approved jd be a final agency action judicially reviewable under the apa a in general two condition must be satisfy for a agency action to be final under the apa first the action must mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking process and second the action must be one by which rights or obligation have be determine or from which legal consequence will

form instructional guidebook and typically remain valid for a period of five year see cfr pt app c the corps itself describe approve jds as final agency action id a the definitive nature of approve jds also give rise to direct and appreciable legal consequence thereby satisfy bennett second condition as well at a negative jd a approve jd state that property do not contain jurisdictional water create a safe harbor from civil enforcement proceedings bring by the government and limit the potential liability a property owner face for violate the clean water act see a each of those effect be a legal consequence it follow that a affirmative jd like the one issue here also have legal consequence it deprive property owner of the safe harbor that negative jd afford this conclusion track the pragmatic approach the court have long take to finality abbott laboratories gardner b a final agency action be reviewable under the apa only if there be no adequate alternative to apa review in court the corps contend that respondent have two such alternative they may proceed without a permit and argue in a government enforcement action that a permit be not require or they may complete the permit process and then seek judicial review which the corps suggest be what congress envision neither alternative be adequate party need not await enforcement proceedings before challenge final agency action where such proceedings carry the risk of serious criminal and civil penalty abbott at and the permit process be not only costly and lengthy but also irrelevant to the finality of the approve jd and its suitability for judicial review furthermore because the clean water act make no reference to standalone jurisdictional determination there be little basis for infer anything from it concern they reviewability give the apa presumption of reviewability for all final agency action sackett epa t he mere fact that permit decision be reviewable be insufficient to imply exclusion as to other agency action such as approve jds abbott at affirm roberts deliver the opinion of the court in which kennedy thomas breyer alito sotomayor and kagan join kennedy file a concur opinion in which thomas

formal error in order that correction may be make before the preliminary print go to press united state army corps of engineer petitioner hawkes et on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the eighth circuit may chief justice roberts deliver the opinion of the court the clean water act regulate the discharge of pollutant into the water of the united states a because it can be difficult to determine whether a particular parcel of property contain such water the army corps of engineers will issue to property owner a approve jurisdictional determination state the agency definitive view on that matter see cfr and pt app c the question present be whether that determination be final agency action judicially reviewable under the administrative procedure act i a the clean water act prohibit the discharge of any pollutant without a permit into navigable water which it define in turn as the water of the united states a during the time period relevant to this case the army corps of engineers define the water of the united states to include land area occasionally or regularly saturate with water such as mudflat sandflat wetland slough prairie pothole wet meadow and playa lakes the use degradation or destruction of which could affect interstate or foreign commerce cfr a the corps have apply that definition to assert jurisdiction over million acre of swampy land in the united states include half of alaska and a area the size of california in the lower states rapanos united states plurality opinion it be often difficult to determine whether a particular piece of property contain water of the united states but there be important consequence if it do the clean water act impose substantial criminal and civil penalty for discharge any pollutant into water cover by the act without a permit from the corps see a c d a the cost of obtain such a permit be significant for a specialize individual permit of the sort at issue in this case for example one study find that the average applicant spend day and in complete the process without count cost of mitigation or design change rapanos at even more readily available general permit take applicant on average day and to complete ibid see generally cfr h limit general permit to activity that cause only minimal individual and cumulative environmental impact the corps specify whether particular property contain water of the united states by issue jurisdictional determination jd on a basis jd come in two variety preliminary and approve ibid while preliminary jd merely advise a property owner that there may be water of the united states on a parcel approve jds definitively stat e the presence or absence of such water ibid emphasis add unlike preliminary jd approve jds can be administratively appeal and be define by regulation to constitute a corps final agency action a they be bind for five year on both the corps and the environmental protection agency which share authority to enforce the clean water act see s cfr pt app c epa memorandum of agreement exemption under section f of the clean water act memorandum of agreement b respondent be three company engage in mining peat in marshall county minnesota peat be a organic material that form in waterlogged grounds such as wetland and bog see xuehui jinming peat and peatlands in coal oil shale natural bitumen heavy oil and peat jinsheng

blame but themselves for errant putt see monteith welton use of peat and other organic materials on golf courses bulletin of the united states golf association green section at the same time peat mining can have significant environmental and ecological impact see peat and peatlands and therefore be regulate by both federal and state environmental protection agency see stat respondent own a tract near they exist mining operation the tract include wetland which respondent believe contain sufficient high quality peat suitable for use in golf green to extend they mining operation for to year app in december respondent apply to the corps for a section permit for the property at a section permit authorize the discharge of dredge or fill material into the navigable water at specify disposal site a over the course of several communication with respondent corps official signal that the permit process would be very expensive and take year to complete the corps also advise respondent that if they wish to pursue they application they would have to submit numerous assessment of various feature of the property which respondent estimate would cost more than app in february in connection with the permit process the corps issue a approve jd state that the property contain water of the united states because its wetland have a significant nexus to the red river of the north located some mile away at respondent appeal the jd to the corps mississippi valley division commander who remand for further factfinding on remand the corps reaffirm its original conclusion and issue a revise jd to that effect at app to pet for cert respondent then seek judicial review of the revise jd under the administrative procedure act apa et the district court dismiss for want of subject matter jurisdiction hold that the revise jd be not final agency action for which there be no other adequate remedy in a court as require by the apa prior to judicial review supp the court of appeals for the eighth circuit reverse and we grant certiorari ii the corps contend that the revise jd be not final agency action and that even if it be there be adequate alternative for challenge it in court we disagree at both turn a in bennett spear we distil from we precedent two condition that generally must be satisfy for agency action to be final under the apa first the action must mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking process it must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature and second the action must be one by which rights or obligation have be determine or from which legal consequence will flow at internal quotation mark and citation omit the corps do not dispute that a approve jd satisfy the first bennett condition unlike preliminary jd which be advisory in nature and simply indicate that there may be water of the united states on a parcel of property cfr a approve jd clearly mark s the consummation of the corps decisionmaking process on that question bennett at internal quotation mark omit it be issue after extensive factfinding by the corps regard the physical and hydrological characteristic of the property see army corps of engineers jurisdictional determination form instructional guidebook and be typically not revisit if the permit process move forward indeed the corps itself describe approve jds as final agency action see cfr a and specify that a approve jd will remain valid for a period of five year corps regulatory guidance letter a june guidance letter see also cfr pt app the corps may revise a approve jd within the period base on new information guidance letter a at that possibility however be a common characteristic of agency action and do not make a otherwise definitive decision nonfinal see sackett epa see also national cable telecommunications brand x internet services by issue respondent a approve jd the corps for all practical purpose have rule definitively that respondent property contain jurisdictional water sackett at ginsburg concur slip at the definitive nature of approve jds also give rise to direct and appreciable legal consequence thereby satisfy the second prong of bennett at consider the effect of a approve jd state that a party property do not contain jurisdictional water a negative jd in corps parlance as note such a jd will generally bind the corps for five year see cfr pt app c guidance letter under a longstanding memorandum of agreement between the corps and epa it will also be bind on the government and represent the government position in any subsequent federal action or litigation concern that final determination memorandum of agreement a negative jd thus bind the two agency authorize to bring civil enforcement proceedings under the clean water act see create a safe harbor from such proceedings for a property owner additionally although the property owner may still face a citizen suit under the act such a suit unlike action bring by the government can not impose civil liability for wholly past violation see d a gwaltney of smithfield chesapeake bay foundation in other word a negative jd both narrow the field of potential plaintiff and limit the potential liability a landowner face for discharge pollutant without a permit each of those effect be a legal consequence satisfy the second bennett prong at see also sackett at it follow that affirmative jd have legal consequence as well they represent the denial of the safe harbor that negative jd afford see define agency action to include a agency rule order license sanction relief or the equivalent or the denial thereof because legal consequence flow from approve jds they constitute final agency action bennett at internal quotation mark omit this conclusion track the pragmatic approach we have long take to finality abbott laboratories gardner for example in frozen food express united states we consider the finality of a order specify which commodity the interstate commerce commission believe be exempt by statute from regulation and which it believe be not although the order have no authority except to give notice of how the commission interpret the relevant statute and would have effect only if and when a particular action be bring against a particular carrier abbott at we hold that the order be nonetheless immediately reviewable frozen food at the order we explain warn every carrier who do not have authority from the commission to transport those commodity that it do so at the risk of incur criminal penalty at so too here while no administrative or criminal proceeding can be bring for failure to conform to the approve jd itself that final agency determination not only deprive respondent of a safe harbor from liability under the act but warn that if they discharge pollutant onto they property without obtain a permit from the corps they do so at the risk of significant criminal and civil penalty b even if final a agency action be reviewable under the apa only if there be no adequate alternative to apa review in court the corps contend that respondent have two such alternative either discharge fill material without a permit risk a epa enforcement action during which they can argue that no permit be require or apply for a permit and seek judicial review if dissatisfy with the result brief for petitioner neither alternative be adequate as we have long hold party need not await enforcement proceedings before challenge final agency action where such proceedings carry the risk of s
