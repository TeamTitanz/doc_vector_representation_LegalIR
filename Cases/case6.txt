the federal power act fpa authorize the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to regulate the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce include both wholesale electricity rate and any rule or practice affect such rate b a a but it place beyond ferc power leave to the states alone the regulation of any other sale any retail sale of electricity b in a increasingly competitive interstate electricity market ferc have undertake to ensure just and reasonable wholesale rate a by encourage the creation of nonprofit entity to manage region of the nationwide electricity grid these wholesale market operator administer they portion of the grid to ensure that the network conduct electricity reliably and each hold competitive auction to set wholesale price these auction balance supply and demand continuously by match bid to provide electricity from generator with order from utility and other entity ls that buy power at wholesale for resale to user all bid to supply electricity be stack from lowest to highest and accept in that order until all request for power have be meet every electricity supplier be pay the price of the bid know as the locational marginal price lmp in period of high electricity demand price can reach extremely high level as the least efficient generator have they supply bid accept in the wholesale market auction not only do rate rise dramatically during these peak period but the increase flow of electricity threaten to overload the grid and cause substantial service problem face with these challenge wholesale market operator devise wholesale demand response program which pay consumer for commitment to reduce they use of power during these peak period just like bid to supply electricity offer from aggregator of multiple user of electricity or large individual consumer to reduce consumption can be bid into the wholesale market auction when it cost less to pay consumer to refrain from use power than it do to pay producer to supply more of it demand response can lower these wholesale price and increase grid reliability wholesale operator begin integrate these program into they market some year ago and ferc authorize they use congress subsequently encourage further development of demand response spur on by congress ferc issue order which among other thing require wholesale market operator to receive demand response bid from aggregator of electricity consumer except when the state regulatory authority oversee those user retail purchase bar demand response participation cfr g concerned that the order have not go far enough ferc then issue the rule under review here order g v rule it require market operator to pay the same price to demand response provider for conserve energy as to generator for produce it so long as a net benefit test which ensure that accept bid actually save consumer money be meet the rule reject a alternative compensation scheme that would have subtract from lmp the savings consumer receive from not buy electricity in the retail market a formula know as the rule also reject claim that ferc lack statutory authority to regulate the compensation operator pay for demand response bid the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacate the rule hold that ferc lack authority to issue the order because it directly regulate the retail electricity market and hold in the alternative that the rule compensation scheme be arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act hold the fpa provide ferc with the authority to regulate wholesale market operator compensation of demand response bid the court analysis proceeds in three part first the practice at issue directly affect wholesale rate second ferc have not regulate retail sale take together these conclusion establish that the rule comply with the fpa plain term third the contrary view would conflict with the fpa core purpose a the practice at issue directly affect wholesale rate the fpa have delegate to ferc the authority and indeed the duty to ensure that rule or practice affect wholesale rate be just and reasonable a a to prevent the statute from assume breadth see new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins this court adopt the circuit construction limit ferc affect jurisdiction to rule or practice that directly affect the wholesale rate california independent system operator ferc emphasis add that standard be easily meet here wholesale demand response be all about reduce wholesale rate so too the rule and practice that determine how those program operate that be particularly true here as the formula for compensate demand response necessarily lower wholesale electricity price by displace generation bid b the rule also do not regulate retail electricity sale in violation of b a ferc regulation do not run afoul of b proscription just because it affect the quantity or term of retail sale transaction occur on the wholesale market have natural consequence at the retail level and so too of necessity will ferc regulation of those wholesale matter that be of no legal consequence see mississippi power light mississippi ex rel moore when ferc regulate what take place on the wholesale market as part of carry out its charge to improve how that market run then no matter the effect on retail rate b impose no bar here every aspect of ferc regulatory plan happen exclusively on the wholesale market and govern exclusively that market rule the commission justification for regulate demand response be likewise only about improve the wholesale market oneok learjet c in addition epsa position would subvert the fpa epsa argument suggest that the entire practice of wholesale demand response fall outside what ferc can regulate and epsa concede that states also lack that authority but under the fpa wholesale demand response program could not go forward if no entity have jurisdiction to regulate they that outcome would flout the fpa core purpose of protect against excessive price and ensure effective transmission of electric power pennsylvania water power fpc see gulf states util fpc the fpa should not be read against its clear term to halt a practice that so evidently enable ferc to fulfill its statutory duty of hold down price and enhance reliability in the wholesale energy market ferc decision to compensate demand response provider at lmp the same price pay to generator instead of at be not arbitrary and capricious under the narrow scope of review in motor vehicle mfrs of united states state farm mut automobile ins this court important but limited role be to ensure that ferc engage in reason decisionmaking that it weigh compete view select a compensation formula with adequate support in

justice kagan deliver the opinion of the court the federal power act fpa or act stat as amend et authorize the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or commission to regulate the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce include both wholesale electricity rate and any rule or practice affect such rate b a but the law place beyond ferc power and leave to the states alone the regulation of any other sale most notably any retail sale of electricity b that statutory division generate a steady flow of jurisdictional dispute because in point of fact if not of law the wholesale and retail market in electricity be inextricably link these case concern a practice call demand response in which operator of wholesale market pay electricity consumer for commitment not to use power at certain time that practice arise because wholesale market operator can sometimes say on a muggy august day offer electricity both more cheaply and more reliably by pay user to dial down they consumption than by pay power plant to ramp up they production in the regulation challenge here ferc require those market operator in specify circumstance to compensate the two service equivalently that be to pay the same price to demand response provider for conserve energy as to generator for make more of it two issue be present here first and do the fpa permit ferc to regulate these demand response transaction at all or do any such rule impinge on the states authority second even if ferc have the requisite statutory power do the commission fail to justify adequately why demand response provider and electricity producer should receive the same compensation the court below rule against ferc on both score we disagree i a federal regulation of electricity owe its beginning to one of this court decision in the early century state and local agency oversee nearly all generation transmission and distribution of electricity but this court hold in public util comm of attleboro steam that the commerce clause bar the states from regulate certain interstate electricity transaction include wholesale sale sale for resale across state line that ruling create what become know as the attleboro gap a regulatory void which the court pointedly note only congress could fill see at congress respond to that invitation by pass the fpa in the act charge ferc predecessor agency with undertaking effective federal regulation of the expand business of transmit and sell electric power in interstate commerce new york ferc quote gulf states util fpc under the statute the commission have authority to regulate the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce b in particular the fpa obligate ferc to oversee all price for those interstate transaction and all rule and practice affect such price the statute provide that a ll rate and charge make demand or receive by any public utility for or in connection with interstate transmission or wholesale sale as well as all rule and regulation affect or pertain to such rate or charge must be just and reasonable a and if any rate or charge or any rule regulation practice or contract affect such rate or charge fall short of that standard the commission must rectify the problem it then shall determine what be just and reasonable and impose the same by order a alongside those grant of power however the act also limit ferc regulatory reach and thereby maintain a zone of exclusive state jurisdiction as pertinent here b the same provision that give ferc authority over wholesale sale state that this subchapter include its delegation to ferc shall not apply to any other sale of electric energy accordingly the commission may not regulate either wholesale sale or more pertinent here retail sale of electricity sale directly to user see new york at state utility commission continue to oversee those transaction since the fpa passage electricity have increasingly become a competitive interstate business and ferc role have evolve accordingly decade ago state or local utility control they own power plant transmission line and delivery system operate as vertically integrate monopoly in confine geographic area that be no longer so independent power plant now abound and almost all electricity flow not through the local power network of the past but instead through a interconnect grid of scope see at electricity that enter the grid immediately become a part of a vast pool of energy that be constantly move in interstate commerce link producer and user across the country in this new world ferc often forgo the traditionally use to prevent monopolistic pricing the commission instead undertake to ensure just and reasonable wholesale rate by enhance competition attempt as we recently explain to break down regulatory and economic barrier that hinder a free market in wholesale electricity morgan stanley capital group public util dist of snohomish as part of that effort ferc encourage the creation of nonprofit entity to manage wholesale market on a regional basis seven such wholesale market operator now serve area with roughly of the country electricity load a industry term for the amount of electricity use see ferc energy primer a handbook of energy market basics energy primer each administer a portion of the grid provide generator with access to transmission line and ensure that the network conduct electricity reliably see ibid and still more important for present purpose each operator conduct a competitive auction to set wholesale price for electricity these wholesale auction serve to balance supply and demand on a continuous basis produce price for electricity that reflect its value at give location and time throughout each day such a mechanism be need because unlike most product electricity can not be store effectively supplier must generate every day hour and minute the exact amount of power necessary to meet demand from the utility and other entity ls that buy power at wholesale for resale to user to ensure that happen wholesale market operator obtain order from ls indicate how much electricity they need at various time and bid from generator specify how much electricity they can produce at those time and how much they will charge for it operators accept the generator bid in order of cost least expensive first until they satisfy the ls total demand the price of the last unit of electricity purchase be then pay to every supplier whose bid be accept regardless of its actual offer and the total cost be split among the ls in proportion to how much energy they have order so for example suppose that at on august four plant serve washington can each produce some amount of electricity for respectively and and suppose that ls demand at that time and place be meet after the operator accept the three cheapest bid the first three generator would then all receive that amount be think back to econ the marginal cost the add cost of meeting another unit of demand which be the price a efficient market would produce see kahn the economics of regulation principle and institution ferc call that cost in jargon that will soon become oddly familiar the locational marginal price or lmp as in any market when wholesale buyer demand for electricity increase the price they must pay rise correspondingly and in those time of peak load the grid reliability may also falter suppose that by on august it be degree in c in every home store or office people be turn the air conditioning up to keep provide power to they customer utility and other ls must ask they market operator for more electricity to meet that spike in demand the operator will have to accept more expensive bid from supplier the operator that be will have to agree to the bid that it spurn before and maybe beyond that to bid of or or in such period operator often must call on extremely inefficient generator whose high cost of production cause they to sit idle most of the time see energy primer as that happen lmp the price pay by all ls to all supplier climb ever higher and meanwhile the increase flow of electricity through the grid threaten to overload transmission line see at as every consumer know it be just when the weather be hottest and the need for air conditioning most acute that blackout brownout and other service problem tend to occur make matter worse the wholesale electricity market lack the mechanism of other market usually when the price of a product rise buyer naturally adjust by reduce how much they purchase but consumer of electricity and therefore the utility and other ls buy power for they at wholesale do not respond to price signal in that way to use the economic term demand for electricity be inelastic that be in part because electricity be a necessity with few ready substitute when the temperature reach degree many people see no option but to switch on the ac and still more many state regulator insulate consumer from fluctuation in wholesale price by insist that ls set stable retail rate see at that one might say the normal rule of economic behavior even in peak period as cost surge in the wholesale market consumer feel no pinch and so keep run the ac as before that mean in turn that ls must keep buy power to send to those user no matter that wholesale price spiral out of control and increase usage risk overtax the grid but what if there be a alternative to that scenario consider what would happen if wholesale market operator could induce consumer to refrain from use and so ls from buying electricity during peak period whenever do that cost less than add more power a operator could bring electricity supply and demand into balance at a lower price and simultaneously the operator could ease pressure on the grid thus protect against system failure that be the idea behind the practice at issue here wholesale demand response as it be call pay consumer for commitment to curtail they use of power so as to curb wholesale rate and prevent grid breakdown see at these demand response program work through the operator regular auction aggregator of multiple user of electricity as well as individual user like factory or store submit bid to decrease electricity consumption by a set amount at a set time for a set price the wholesale market operator treat those offer just like bid from generator to increase supply the operator that be rank order all the bid both to produce and to refrain from consuming electricity from least to most expensive and then accept the lowest bid until supply and demand come into equipoise and once again the ls pick up the cost of all those payment so to return to we prior example if a store submit a offer not to use a unit of electricity at on august for the operator would accept that bid before call on the generator that offer to produce a unit of power for that would result in a lower lmp again wholesale market price than if the market operator could not avail itself of demand response pledge see council harness the power of demand how iso and rto be integrate demand response into wholesale electricity markets estimate that in one market a demand response program reduce electricity usage by in peak hour would lead to price decline of to and it would decrease the risk of blackout and other service problem wholesale market operator begin use demand response some year ago soon after they assume the role of oversee wholesale electricity sale recognize the value of demand response for both system reliability and efficient pricing they urge ferc to allow they to implement such program see pjm interconnection order accepting tariff sheet as modified ferc california independent system operator order conditionally accept for filing tariff revision ferc and as demand response go into effect market participant of many kind come to view it in the word of respondent electric power supply association epsa as a important element of robust competitive wholesale electricity market app epsa comment on propose rule on demand response compensation in organized wholesale energy markets may congress add to the chorus of voice praise wholesale demand response in the energy policy act of stat epact it declare as the policy of the united states that such demand response shall be encourage f stat note in particular congress direct the deployment of technology and device that enable electricity customer to participate in demand response system shall be facilitate and unnecessary barrier to demand response participation in energy market shall be eliminate ibid b spur on by congress the commission determine to take a more active role in promote wholesale demand response program in ferc issue order which among other thing require wholesale market operator to receive demand response bid from aggregator of electricity consumer except when the state regulatory authority oversee those user retail purchase bar such demand response participation see fed reg codify cfr g that original order allow operator to compensate demand response provider differently from generator if they so choose no party seek judicial review concerned that order have not go far enough ferc issue the rule under review here in with one commissioner dissenting see demand response competition in organized wholesale energy markets order fed reg rule codify cfr g v the rule attempt to ensure just and reasonable wholesale rate by require market operator to appropriately compensate demand response provider and thus bring about meaningful participation in the wholesale market fed reg a the rule most significant provision direct operator under two specified condition to pay lmp for any accept demand response bid just as they do for successful supply bid see fed reg in other word the rule require that demand response provider in those circumstance receive as much for conserve electricity as generator do for produce it the two specified condition ensure that a bid to use less electricity provide the same value to the wholesale market as a bid to make more first a demand response bidder must have the capability to provide the service offer it must that be actually be able to reduce electricity use and thereby obviate the operator need to secure additional power at second pay lmp for a demand response bid must be as measure by a standard call the net benefit test that test make certain that accept a demand response bid over a supply bid will actually save ls wholesale purchaser money in some situation it will not even though accept a bid by definition reduce lmp that be because to oversimplify a bit ls share the cost of pay successful bidder and reduce electricity use make some ls drop out of the market place a proportionally greater burden on those that be leave each remain lse may thus wind up pay more even though the total bill be lower or say otherwise the cost associate with a lse increase share of compensate bid may exceed the savings that the lse obtain from a lower wholesale price the net benefit test screen out such counterproductive demand response bid exempt they from the rule compensation requirement see at what remains be only those offer whose acceptance will result in actual savings to wholesale purchaser along with more reliable service to end user see at the rule reject a alternative scheme for compensate demand response bid several commenter have urge that in pay a demand response provider a operator should subtract from the ordinary wholesale price the savings that the provider net by not buy electricity on the retail market otherwise the commenter claim demand response provider would receive a kind of relative to generator see at that proposal which the dissent commissioner largely accept become know as lmp minus g or more simply where g stand for the retail price of electricity see at moeller dissent but ferc explain that under the condition it have specify the value of a accept demand response bid to the wholesale market be identical to that of a accept supply bid because each succeed in balanc ing supply and demand at and the commission reason that comparable value be what ought to matter give ferc goal of strengthen competition in the wholesale market rates should reflect not the cost that each market participant incur but instead the service it provide see at moreover the rule state compensate demand response bid at they actual value lmp will help overcome various technological barrier include a lack of need infrastructure that impede aggregator and user of electricity from fully participate in demand response program see at the rule also respond to comment challenge ferc statutory authority to regulate the compensation operator pay for demand response bid point to the commission analysis in order the rule explain that the fpa give ferc jurisdiction over such bid because they directly affect wholesale rate at cite at and nonetheless the rule note ferc would continue order policy of allow any state regulatory body to prohibit consumer in its retail market from take part in wholesale demand response program see fed reg at accordingly the rule do not require any action that would violate state law or regulation at c a divided panel of the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit vacate the rule as ultra vire agency action the court hold that ferc lack authority to issue the rule even though demand response compensation affect the wholesale market at the commission jurisdiction to regulate practice affect rate the court state do not erase the specific limit that the fpa impose on ferc regulation of retail sale at and the rule the court conclude exceed that limit in lure retail customer into the wholesale market and cause they to decrease level of retail electricity consumption the rule engage in direct regulation of the retail market at the court of appeals hold alternatively that the rule be arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act a because ferc fail to adequately explain why pay lmp to demand response provider result in just compensation at accord to the court ferc do not properly consider the view that such a payment would give those provider a windfall by leave they with the full lmp plus the savings associate with reduce consumption ibid quote demand response competition in organized wholesale energy markets order on rehearing and clarification order rehearing order ferc moeller dissent the court dismiss out of hand the idea that comparable contribution could be the reason for equal compensation at judge edwards dissent he explain that the rule govern wholesale demand response have a direct effect on wholesale electricity rate squarely within ferc jurisdiction at and in set those rule he argue ferc do not engage in direct regulation of the retail market rather a uthority over retail rate remain vested solely in the states at internal quotation mark omit finally judge edwards reject the majority view that the rule be arbitrary and capricious he note the substantial deference due to the commission in case involve ratemaking and conclude that ferc provide a thorough and reasonable explanation for choose lmp as the appropriate compensation formula at we grant certiorari to decide whether the commission have statutory authority to regulate wholesale market operator compensation of demand response bid and if so whether the rule challenge here be arbitrary and capricious we now hold that the commission have such power and that the rule be adequately reason we accordingly reverse ii we analysis of ferc regulatory authority proceeds in three part first the practice at issue in the rule market operator payment for demand response commitment directly affect wholesale rate second in address those practice the commission have not regulate retail sale take together those conclusion establish that the rule comply with the fpa plain term and third the contrary view would conflict with the act core purpose by prevent all use of a tool that no one not even epsa dispute will curb price and enhance reliability in the wholesale electricity market a the fpa delegate responsibility to ferc to regulate the interstate wholesale market for electricity both wholesale rate and the panoply of rule and practice affect they as note earlier the act establish a scheme for federal regulation of the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce b see supra at under the statute a ll rate and charge make demand or receive by any public utility for or in connection with interstate wholesale sale shall be just and reasonable so too shall all rule and regulation affect or pertain to such rate or charge a and if ferc see a violation of that standard it must take remedial action more specifically whenever the commission shall find that any rate or charge or any rule regulation practice or contract affect such rate or charge be unjust or unreasonable then the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate charge rule regulation practice or contract and impose the same by order a that mean ferc have the authority and indeed the duty to ensure that rule or practice affect wholesale rate be just and reasonable take for all it be worth that statutory grant could extend ferc power to some surprising place as the court below note market in all electricity input steel fuel and labor most prominent among they might affect generator supply of power see at at edwards dissent and for that matter market in just about everything the whole economy as it be might influence ls demand so if indirect or tangential impact on wholesale electricity rate suffice ferc could regulate now in one industry now in another change a vast array of rule and practice to implement its vision of reasonableness and justice we can not imagine that be what congress have in mind for that reason a earlier circuit decision adopt and we now approve a construction of the fpa language limit ferc affect jurisdiction to rule or practice that directly affect the wholesale rate california independent system operator ferc emphasis add see at edwards dissent as we have explain in address similar term like relate to or in connection with a reading be need to prevent the statute from assume breadth see new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins if relate to be take to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy then for all practical purpose the statute would never run its course maracich spears slip at the phrase in connection with be essentially indeterminat e because connection like relation stop nowhere internal quotation mark omit the commission itself incorporate the circuit standard in address its authority to issue the rule see fed reg state that ferc have jurisdiction because wholesale demand response directly affect wholesale rate we think it right to do the same still the rule govern wholesale demand response program meet that standard with room to spare in general and as earlier describe wholesale market operator employ demand response bid in competitive auction that balance wholesale supply and demand and thereby set wholesale price see supra at the operator accept such bid if and only if they bring down the wholesale rate by displace generation and when that occur most often in peak period the easing of pressure on the grid and the avoidance of service problem further contribute to lower charge see brief for grid engineers et as amici curiae wholesale demand response in short be all about reduce wholesale rate so too then the rule and practice that determine how those program operate and that be particularly true of the formula that operator use to compensate demand response provider as in other area of life greater pay lead to greater participation if reward at lmp rather than at some lesser amount more demand response provider will enter more bid capable of displace generation thus necessarily lower wholesale electricity price further the commission find heighten demand response participation will put downward pressure on generator own bid encouraging power plant to offer they product at reduce price lest they come away from the bidding process fed reg that too ratchet down the rate wholesale purchaser pay compensation for demand response thus directly affect wholesale price indeed it be hard to think of a practice that do so more b the above conclusion do not end we inquiry into the commission statutory authority to uphold the rule we also must determine that it do not regulate retail electricity sale that be because as earlier describe b limit s ferc sale jurisdiction to that at wholesale reserve regulatory authority over retail sale as well as intrastate wholesale sale to the states new york at emphasis delete see b supra at ferc can not take a action transgress that limit no matter how direct or dramatic its impact on wholesale rate suppose to take a example that the commission issue a regulation compelling every consumer to buy a certain amount of electricity on the retail market such a rule would necessarily determine the load purchase on the wholesale market too and thus would alter wholesale price but even give that ineluctable consequence the regulation would exceed ferc authority as define in b because it specify term of sale at retail which be a job for the states alone yet a ferc regulation do not run afoul of b proscription just because it affect even substantially the quantity or term of retail sale it be a fact of economic life that the wholesale and retail market in electricity as in every other known product be not hermetically seal from each other to the contrary transaction that occur on the wholesale market have natural consequence at the retail level and so too of necessity will ferc regulation of those wholesale matter oneok learjet slip at note that in the similarly structured world of natural gas regulation a platonic ideal of strict separation between federal and state realm can not exist when ferc set a wholesale rate when it change wholesale market rule when it allocate electricity as between wholesale purchaser in short when it take virtually any action respect wholesale transaction it have some effect in either the short or the long term on retail rate that be of no legal consequence see mississippi power light mississippi ex rel moore hold that a order regulate wholesale purchase fall within ferc jurisdiction and preempt contrary state action even though it clearly affect retail price nantahala power light thornburg same fpc louisiana power light hold similarly in the natural gas context when ferc regulate what take place on the wholesale market as part of carry out its charge to improve how that market run then no matter the effect on retail rate b impose no bar and in set rule for demand response that be all ferc have do the commission rule address and address only transaction occur on the wholesale market recall once again how demand response work and forgive the come italics see supra at wholesale market operator administer the entire program receive every demand response bid make those operator accept such a bid at the mandate price when and only when the bid provide value to the wholesale market by balance supply and demand more ly at a lower cost to wholesale purchaser than a bid to generate power fed reg the compensation pay for a successful bid lmp be whatever the operator auction have determine be the marginal price of wholesale electricity at a particular location and time see at and those foot the bill be the same wholesale purchaser that have benefit from the lower wholesale price demand response participation have produce see at in sum whatever the effect at the retail level every aspect of the regulatory plan happen exclusively on the wholesale market and govern exclusively that market rule what be more the commission justification for regulate demand response be all about and only about improve the wholesale market oneok at slip at consider the target at which a law aim in determine whether a state be properly regulate retail or instead improperly regulate wholesale sale in order ferc explain that demand response participation could help create a competitive wholesale electric energy market with reduce d wholesale power price and enhance d reliability fed reg and in the rule under review ferc expand on that theme it list the several way in which demand response in organize wholesale energy market can help improve the function and competitiveness of those market by replace inefficient generation exert downward pressure on generator bidding strategy and support ing system reliability at see notice of proposed rulemaking for order at note similar aim supra at ferc that be focus wholly on the benefit that demand response participation in the wholesale market could bring to the wholesale market the retail market figure no more in the rule goal than in the mechanism through which the rule operate epsa primary argument that ferc have usurp state power echo in the dissent maintain that the rule effectively even though not nominal ly regulate retail price see brief for respondent tr of oral arg post at the argument begin on universally accept ground under b only the states not ferc can set retail rate see fpc conway but as epsa concede that tenet alone can not make its case because ferc rule do not set actual rate states continue to make or approve all retail rate and in do so may insulate they from price fluctuation in the wholesale market see brief for respondent still epsa contend rudimentary economic analysis show that the rule do the functional equivalen t of setting more particularly of raise retail rate at that be because the opportunity to make demand response bid in the wholesale market change consumer calculation in decide whether to buy electricity at retail consumer now consider both the cost of make such a purchase and the cost of forgo a possible demand response payment so epsa explain if a factory can buy electricity for but can earn for not buy power at peak time then the effective retail rate at those time be the the factory pay at retail plus the it pass up see at and by thus increase effective retail rate epsa conclude ferc trespass on the states ground the modifier effective be do quite a lot of work in that argument more work than any conventional understanding of allow the standard dictionary definition of the term rate as use with reference to price be a n amount pay or charge for a good or service black law dictionary ed see oxford english dictionary ed rate means price cost or sum pay or ask for a thing to set a retail electricity rate be thus to establish the amount of money a consumer will hand over in exchange for power nothing in b or any other part of the fpa suggest a more expansive notion in which ferc set a rate for electricity merely by alter consumer incentive to purchase that product and neither do anything in this court caselaw we decision uniformly speak about rate for electricity and all else in only they most prosaic sense as the solicitor general summarize that view the rate be what it be tr of oral arg it be the price pay not the price pay plus the cost of a forgone economic opportunity consider a familiar scenario to see what be odd about epsa theory imagine that a flight be overbook the airline offer passenger to move to a later plane that have extra seat on epsa view that offer add the cost of not accept the airline proffer payment to the price of every continue passenger ticket so a person who originally spend for he ticket and decide to reject the airline proposal pay a effective price of but would any passenger get off the plane say he have pay to fly that be highly unlikely and airline lawyer and regulator include many we be sure with economics appear to share that view it be in fact illegal to increase the price of air transportation after such air transportation have be purchase by the consumer cfr a but it be a safe bet that no airline have ever get into trouble by offer a payment not to fly and epsa effective price increase claim fare even worse when it come to payment not to use electricity in epsa universe a wholesale demand response program raise retail rate by compelling consumer to pay the price of forgo demand response compensation but such a consumer would be even more surprised than we air traveler to learn of that price hike because the natural consequence of wholesale demand response program be to bring down retail rate once again wholesale market operator accept demand response bid only if those offer lower the wholesale price see supra at and when wholesale price go down retail price tend to follow because state regulator can and mostly do insist that wholesale buyer eventually pass on they savings to consumer epsa theoretical construct thus run headlong into the real world of electricity sale where the rule do anything but increase retail price epsa second argument that ferc intrude into the states sphere be more historical and purposive in nature accord to epsa ferc deliberately lure retail customer into the wholesale market and more ferc do so only because it be dissatisfy with the states exercise of they undoubted authority under b to regulate retail sale brief for respondent see at in particular epsa assert ferc disapprove of many states continued preference for stable pricing that be for insulate retail rate from fluctuation in wholesale cost at in promote demand response program or in epsa somewhat less neutral language in forc ing retail customer to respond to wholesale price signal ferc act for the express purpose of override that state policy at that claim initially founder on the true fact of how wholesale demand response come about contra epsa the commission do not invent the practice rather and as describe earlier the impetus come from wholesale market operator see supra at in design they newly organize market those operator recognize almost at once that demand response would lower wholesale electricity price and improve the grid reliability so they quickly seek and obtain ferc approval to institute such program demand response then emerge not as a commission power grab but instead as a innovation for more optimally balance wholesale electricity supply and demand and when year later after congress too endorse the practice ferc begin to play a more proactive role it do so for the identical reason to enhance the wholesale not retail electricity market like the market operator ferc see that demand in peak period threaten network breakdown compel purchase from inefficient generator and consequently drive up wholesale price see fed reg at see supra at address those problem which demand response do fall within the sweet spot of ferc statutory charge so ferc take action promote the practice no doubt ferc recognize connection run in both direction between the states policy and its own the commission understand that by insulate consumer from price fluctuation states contribute to the wholesale market difficulty in optimally balance supply and demand see fed reg supra at and ferc realize that increase use of demand response in that market would by definition inhibit retail sale otherwise subject to state control see fed reg but nothing support epsa more feverish idea that the commission interest in wholesale demand response emerge from a yen to usurp state authority over or impose its own regulatory agenda on retail sale in promote demand response ferc do no more than follow the dictate of its regulatory mission to improve the competitiveness efficiency and reliability of the wholesale market indeed the finish blow to both of epsa argument come from ferc notable solicitude toward the states as explain earlier the rule allow any state regulator to prohibit its consumer from make demand response bid in the wholesale market see at at supra at although claim the ability to negate such state decision the commission choose not to do so in recognition of the linkage between wholesale and retail market and the states role in oversee retail sale see fed reg the veto power thus grant to the states belie epsa view that ferc aim to obliterate they regulatory authority or override they pricing policy brief for respondent and that veto give states the means to block whatever effective increase in retail rate demand response program might be think to produce wholesale demand response as implement in the rule be a program of cooperative federalism in which the states retain the last word that feature of the rule remove any conceivable doubt as to its compliance with b allocation of federal and state authority c one last point about how epsa position would subvert the fpa epsa jurisdictional claim as may be clear by now stretch very far its point be not that this single rule relate to compensation level exceed ferc power instead epsa argument that rewarding energy conservation raise effective retail rate and that lure consumer onto wholesale market aim to disrupt state policy suggest that the entire practice of wholesale demand response fall outside what ferc can regulate epsa proudly embrace that point ferc it declare have no business regulate demand response at all at under epsa theory ferc earlier order although never challenge would also be ultra vire because it require operator to open they market to demand response bid and more ferc could not even approve a operator voluntary plan to administer a demand response program see tr of oral arg that too would improperly allow a retail customer to participate in a wholesale market yet state commission could not regulate demand response bid either epsa essentially concede this point see brief for respondent that may well be true and so it must the fpa leave no room either for direct state regulation of the price of interstate wholesale or for regulation that would indirectly achieve the same result northern natural gas state corporation comm of a state could not oversee offer make in a wholesale market operator auction that help to set wholesale price any effort of that kind would be preempt and all of that create a problem if neither ferc nor the states can regulate wholesale demand response then by definition no one can but under the act no electricity transaction can proceed unless it be regulable by someone as earlier describe congress pass the fpa precisely to eliminate vacuum of authority over the electricity market see supra at the act make federal and state power complementary and comprehensive so that there will be no gap for private interest to subvert the public welfare louisiana power light at or say otherwise the statute prevent the creation of any regulatory no man land fpc transcontinental gas pipe line see at some entity must have jurisdiction to regulate each and every practice that take place in the electricity market demand response no less than any other for that reason the upshot of epsa view would be to extinguish the wholesale demand response program in its entirety under the fpa each market operator must submit to ferc all its proposed rule and procedure see c d cfr c a assume that as epsa argue ferc could not authorize any demand response program as part of that package nor could ferc simply allow such plan to go into effect without its consideration and approval there be no off the book program in the wholesale electricity market because once again there be no regulatory no man land transcontinental at the fpa mandate that ferc review and ensure the reasonableness of every wholesale rule and practice see a a supra at if ferc could not carry out that duty for demand response then those program could not go forward and that outcome would flout the fpa core object the statute aim to protect against excessive price and ensure effective transmission of electric power pennsylvania water power fpc see gulf states util fpc as show above ferc have amply explain how wholesale demand response help to achieve those end by bring down cost and prevent service interruption in peak period see supra at no one take part in the rulemaking process not even epsa seriously challenge that account even as he object to ferc compensation formula commissioner moeller note the unanimity of opinion as to demand response value n owhere do i review any comment or hear any testimony that question the benefit of have demand response resource participate in the organize wholesale energy market on this point there be no debate fed reg see also app epsa comment on propose rule avow full support for demand response participation in wholesale market because of its economic and operational benefit congress itself agree encourag ing greater use of demand response participation at the wholesale level epact f stat that undisputed judgment extinguish any last flicker of life in epsa argument we will not read the fpa against its clear term to halt a practice that so evidently enable the commission to fulfill its statutory duty of hold down price and enhance reliability in the wholesale energy market iii these case present a second narrower question be ferc decision to compensate demand response provider at lmp the same price pay to generator arbitrary and capricious recall here the basic issue see supra at wholesale market operator pay a single price lmp for all successful bid to supply electricity at a give time and place the rule order operator to pay the identical price for a successful bid to conserve electricity so long as that bid can satisfy a net benefit test meaning that it be sure to bring down cost for wholesale purchaser in mandate that payment ferc reject a alternative proposal under which demand response provider would receive lmp minus g where g be the retail rate for electricity accord to epsa and other favor that approach demand response provider get a windfall a kind of unless market operator subtract the savings associate with conserve electricity from the ordinary compensation level fed reg epsa now claim that ferc fail to adequately justify its choice of lmp rather than in review that decision we may not substitute we own judgment for that of the commission the scope of review under the arbitrary and capricious standard be narrow motor vehicle mfrs of united states state farm mut automobile ins a court be not to ask whether a regulatory decision be the best one possible or even whether it be better than the alternative rather the court must uphold a rule if the agency have examine d the relevant consideration and articulate d a satisfactory explanation for its action include a rational connection between the fact find and the choice make ibid internal quotation mark omit and nowhere be that more true than in a technical area like electricity rate design w e afford great deference to the commission in its rate decision morgan stanley at here the commission give a detailed explanation of its choice of lmp see fed reg rely on a eminent regulatory economist view ferc chiefly reason that demand response bid should get the same compensation as generator bid because both provide the same value to a wholesale market see at see also app reply affidavit of alfred kahn kahn affidavit ferc note that a market operator need to constantly balance supply and demand and that either kind of bid can perform that service in a way that lower cost for wholesale purchaser see fed reg a compensation system ferc conclude therefore should place the two kind of bid on a competitive par at quote kahn affidavit see also app kahn affidavit state that economic efficiency require compensate the two equally give they equivalent function in a competitive power market with both supply and demand response available on equal term the operator will select whichever bid of whichever kind provide the need electricity at the lowest possible cost see rehearing order ferc at by ensure that both receive the same compensation for the same service we expect the final rule to enhance the competitiveness of wholesale market and result in just and reasonable rate that rationale receive add support from ferc adoption of the net benefit test the commission realize during its rulemaking that in some circumstance a demand response bid despite reduce the wholesale rate do not provide the same value as generation see fed reg as describe earlier that happen when the distinctive cost associate with compensate a demand response bid exceed the savings from a lower wholesale rate the purchaser then wind up pay more than if the operator have accept the best even though higher price supply bid available see supra at and so ferc develop the net benefit test to filter out such case see fed reg with that standard in place lmp be pay only to demand response bid that benefit wholesale purchaser in other word to those that function as alternative s to the next generation at thus under the commission approach a demand response provider will receive the same compensation as a generator only when it be in fact provide the same service to the wholesale market see the commission respond at length to epsa contrary view that pay lmp even in that situation will overcompensate demand response provider because they be also effectively receiv ing g the retail rate that they do not need to pay at ferc explain that compensation ordinarily reflect only the value of the service a entity provide not the cost it incur or benefit it obtain in the process so when a generator present a bid the commission do not inquire into the cost or benefit of production different power plant have different cost structure and indeed some plant receive tax credit and similar incentive payment for they activity while other do not see rehearing order ferc at and but the commission have long since decide that such matter be irrelevant pay lmp to all generator although some then walk away with more profit and some with less encourage more efficient supply and demand decision fed reg internal quotation mark omit and the commission could see no economic reason to treat demand response provider any differently like generator they too experience a range of benefit and cost both the benefit of not pay for electricity and the cost of not use it at a certain time but ferc again conclude that be immaterial to increase competition and optimally balance supply and demand market operator should compensate demand response provider like generator base on they contribution to the wholesale system see ferc at moreover ferc find pay lmp will help demand response provider overcome certain barrier to participation in the wholesale market see fed reg commenter have detail significant expense associate with demand response include the cost of install necessary metering technology and energy management system see at see also app viridity energy comment on propose rule on demand response compensation in organized wholesale energy markets may note the capital investment and operational change need for demand response participation the commission agree that such factor inhibit potential demand responder from compete with generator in the wholesale market see fed reg it conclude that rewarding demand response at lmp which be in any event the price reflect its value to the market will encourage that competition and in turn bring down wholesale price see ibid finally the commission note that determine the g in the formula be easier propose than accomplish see retail rate vary across and even within states and change over time as well accordingly ferc conclude require market operator to incorporate g into they price even though perhaps feasible would create practical difficulty ibid better then not to impose that administrative burden all of that together be enough the commission not this or any other court regulate electricity rate the dispute question here involve both technical understanding and policy judgment the commission address that issue seriously and carefully provide reason in support of its position and respond to the principal alternative advance in uphold that action we do not discount the cogency of epsa argument in favor of nor do we say that in opt for lmp instead ferc make the better call it be not we job to render that judgment on which reasonable mind can differ we important but limited role be to ensure that the commission engage in reason decisionmaking that it weigh compete view select a compensation formula with adequate support in the record and intelligibly explain the reason for make that choice ferc satisfy that standard iv ferc statutory authority extend to the rule at issue here address wholesale demand response the rule govern a practice directly affect wholesale electricity rate and although inevitably influence the retail market too the rule do not intrude on the states power to regulate retail sale ferc set the term of transaction occur in the organize wholesale market so as to ensure the reasonableness of wholesale price and the reliability of the interstate grid just as the fpa contemplate and in choose a compensation formula the commission meet its duty of reason judgment ferc take full account of the alternative policy propose and adequately support and explain its decision accordingly we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion it be so order justice alito take no part in the consideration or decision of these case scalia dissent and et al et et al on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the district of columbia circuit january justice scalia with whom justice thomas join dissent i believe the federal power act fpa or act et prohibit the federal energy regulatory commission ferc from regulate the demand response of retail purchaser of power i respectfully dissent from the court hold to the contrary i a i agree with the majority that ferc have the authority to regulate practice affect wholesale rate a a mississippi power light mississippi ex rel moore i also agree that this affect jurisdiction can not be limitless and i suppose i could even live with the court direct effect test as a reasonable limit ante at but as the majority recognize ante at that extratextual limit on the affect jurisdiction merely supplement not supplant limit that be already contain in the statutory text and structure i believe the court misconstrue the primary statutory limit like the majority i think that deference under chevron natural resources defense council be unwarranted because the statute be clear the act grant ferc authority to regulate the generation and transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of such energy at wholesale a yet the majority frame the issue thusly t o uphold the r ule we also must determine that it do not regulate retail electricity sale ante at that formulation invert the proper inquiry the pertinent question under the act be whether the rule regulate sale at wholesale if so it fall within ferc regulatory authority if not the rule be unauthorized whether or not it happen to regulate retail electricity sale for with exception not material here the fpa prohibit ferc from regulate any other sale of electric energy that be not at wholesale b emphasis add the majority wisely ignore ferc specious argument that the rule do not regulate any sale wholesale or retail see brief for petitioner in pay someone not to conclude a transaction that otherwise would without a doubt have be conclude be most assuredly a regulation of that transaction gonzales raich scalia concur in judgment properly frame the inquiry matter not because i think there exist some undefined category of electricity sale that be and ante at but because a proper framing of the inquiry be important to establish the default presumption regard the scope of ferc authority while the majority would find every sale of electric energy to be within ferc authority to regulate unless the transaction be demonstrably a retail sale the statute actually exclude from ferc jurisdiction all sale of electric energy except those that be demonstrably sale at wholesale so what exactly be a sale of electric energy at wholesale we need not guess for the act provide a definition a sale of electric energy to any person for resale d emphasis add no matter how many time the majority incant and italicize the word wholesale ante at nothing can change the fact that the vast majority of and likely all participant a ggregator of multiple user of electricity as well as individual user like factory or store ante at do not resell electric energy they consume it themselves ferc own definition of demand response be aim at energy consumer not reseller cfr b it be therefore quite beside the point that the challenge r ule address and address only transaction occur on the wholesale market ante at for ferc regulatory authority over sale depend not on which market the transaction occu r on whatever that mean but rather on the identity of the putative purchaser if the purchaser be one who resell electric energy to other customer the transaction be one at wholesale and thus within ferc authority if not then not or so at least say the statute as we long ago say of the parallel provision in the natural gas act t he line of the statute i be thus clear and complete it cut s sharply and cleanly between sale for resale and direct sale for consumptive use no exception a re make in either category for particular use quantity or otherwise panhandle eastern pipe line public serv comm of the majority make no textual response to this plain reading of the statute the bidder here indisputably do not resell energy to other customer it follow that the rule do not regulate sale at wholesale and b therefore forbid ferc to regulate these transaction see new york ferc that be so whether or not those transaction directly affect wholesale rate as we recently say in another context we will not adopt a construction that needlessly produce a contradiction in the statutory text shapiro mcmanus slip at a faithful application of that principle would compel the conclusion that ferc may not do under a and a what it be forbid to do under b at slip at b the analysis could stop there but the majority be wrong even on its own term for the rule at issue here do in fact regulate retail electricity sale which be indisputably matter subject to regulation by the states and therefore to ferc a see fpc conway panhandle eastern pipe line supra at the participant be retail customer they purchase electric energy solely for they own consumption and ferc scheme be intentionally design to induce lower consumption of electric energy in other word to induce a reduction in retail electricity sale by offer incentive payment to those customer cfr b the incentive payment effectively increase the retail price of electric energy for participate customer because they must now account for the opportunity cost of use as oppose to abstain from use more energy in other word it literally cost they more to buy energy on the retail market in the court below ferc concede that offer credit to retail customer to reduce they electricity consumption would be a impermissible intrusion into the retail market because it would in effect regulate retail rate cadc incentive payment be identical in substance the majority resist this elementary economic conclusion notwithstanding its own exhortation to think back to econ ante at why because its view dictate otherwise ante at maybe the easiest way to see the majority error be to take its own example a airline passenger who reject a voucher for take a later flight consider the follow formulation of that example in substance from the majority formulation because the hypothetical passenger have exactly the same option and outcome available to he suppose the airline say to the passenger we have proactively cancel you ticket and refund to you account and because we have inconvenience you we have also deposit a extra the money be yours to use as you like but if you insist on repurchase a ticket on the same flight you must not only pay we but return the too now what be the effective price of the ticket sometimes a allegedly commonsensical intuition be just that a intuition often mistaken move closer to home recall that participant must choose either to purchase a unit of energy at the prevail retail price say or to withhold from purchase that unit and receive instead a incentive payment of say the two option thus present a choice between have a unit of energy on the one hand and have more in the bank on the other to repeat take the energy be poorer forgo the energy be richer be that not the very definition of price see black law dictionary ed t he amount of money or other consideration ask for or give in exchange for something else in fact be that not the majority definition of price ante at the amount of money a consumer will hand over in exchange for power in any event the majority appear to recognize that the effective price be indeed just as the effective price of the airline ticket in the hypothetical be ante at that recognition give away the game for ferc be prohibit not just from directly set or modify retail price it be prohibit from regulate retail sale no matter the means panhandle eastern pipe line supra at whether ferc set the real retail price to use the majority idiosyncratic terminology ante at or the effective retail price be immaterial either way the rule by design induce participant to forgo retail purchase they otherwise would have make as note even ferc concede that offer credit to retail customer would impermissibly regulate retail sale the majority blithely overlook this concession in favor of its own view of retail pricin
