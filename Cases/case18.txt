north carolina dental practice act act provide that the north carolina state board of dental examiner board be the agency of the state for the regulation of the practice of dentistry the board principal duty be to create administer and enforce a licensing system for dentist and six of its eight member must be license practice dentist the act do not specify that tooth whitening be the practice of dentistry nonetheless after dentist complain to the board that nondentist be charge lower price for such service than dentist do the board issue at least official letter to nondentist tooth whitening service provider and product manufacturer often warn that the unlicensed practice of dentistry be a crime this and other related board action lead nondentist to cease offering tooth whitening service in north carolina the federal trade commission ftc file a administrative complaint allege that the board concerted action to exclude nondentist from the market for tooth whitening service in north carolina constitute a anticompetitive and unfair method of competition under the federal trade commission act a administrative law judge alj deny the board motion to dismiss on the ground of immunity the ftc sustain that ruling reasoning that even if the board have act pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy to displace competition the board must be actively supervise by the state to claim immunity which it be not after a hearing on the merit the alj determine that the board have unreasonably restrained trade in violation of antitrust law the ftc again sustain the alj and the fourth circuit affirm the ftc in all respects hold because a control number of the board decisionmaker be active market participant in the occupation the board regulate the board can invoke antitrust immunity only if it be subject to active supervision by the state and here that requirement be not meet a federal antitrust law be a central safeguard for the nation free market structure however require state to conform to the mandate of the sherman act at the expense of other value a state may deem fundamental would impose a impermissible burden on the states power to regulate therefore begin with parker brown this court interpret the antitrust law to confer immunity on the anticompetitive conduct of states act in they sovereign capacity b the board action be not cloak with parker immunity a nonsovereign actor control by active market participant such as the board enjoy parker immunity only if the challenge restraint be clearly articulate and affirmatively express as state policy and the policy be actively supervise by the state ftc phoebe putney health system quote california retail liquor dealers midcal aluminum here the board do not receive active supervision of its anticompetitive conduct a entity may not invoke parker immunity unless its action be a exercise of the state sovereign power see columbia omni outdoor advertising thus where a state delegate control over a market to a nonsovereign actor the sherman act confer immunity only if the state accept political accountability for the anticompetitive conduct it permit and control limit on immunity be most essential when a state seek to delegate its regulatory power to active market participant for dual allegiance be not always apparent to a actor and prohibition against anticompetitive by active market participant be a axiom of federal antitrust policy accordingly parker immunity require that the anticompetitive conduct of nonsovereign actor especially those authorize by the state to regulate they own profession result from procedure that suffice to make it the state own midcal test provide a proper analytical framework to resolve the ultimate question whether a anticompetitive policy be indeed the policy of a state the first requirement clear articulation rarely will achieve that goal by itself for entity purport to act under state authority might diverge from the state consider definition of the public good and engage in private the second midcal requirement active supervision seek to avoid this harm by require the state to review and approve interstitial policy make by the entity claim immunity there be instance in which a actor can be excuse from midcal active supervision requirement municipality which be electorally accountable have general regulatory power and have no private agenda be subject exclusively to the clear articulation requirement see hallie eau claire that hallie excuse municipality from midcal supervision rule for these reason however all but confirm the rule applicability to actor control by active market participant further in light of omni hold that a otherwise immune entity will not lose immunity base on ad hoc and ex post question of its motive for make particular decision at it be all the more necessary to ensure the condition for grant immunity be meet in the first place see ftc ticor title ins and phoebe putney supra at the clear lesson of precedent be that midcal active supervision test be a essential prerequisite of parker immunity for any nonsovereign entity public or private control by active market participant the board argument that entity designate by the states as agency be exempt from midcal second requirement can not be reconcile with the court repeat conclusion that the need for supervision turn not on the formal designation give by states to regulator but on the risk that active market participant will pursue private interest in restrain trade state agency control by active market participant pose the very risk of midcal supervision requirement be create to address see goldfarb virginia state bar this conclusion do not question the good faith of state officer but rather be a assessment of the structural risk of market participant confuse they own interest with the state policy goal while hallie state it be likely that active state supervision would also not be require for agency at the entity there be more like prototypical state agency not specialize board dominate by active market participant the latter be similar to private trade association vest by states with regulatory authority which must satisfy midcal active supervision standard at the similarity between agency control by active market participant and such association be not eliminate simply because the former be give a formal designation by the state vest with a measure of government power and require to follow some procedural rule see hallie supra at when a state empower a group of active market participant to decide who can participate in its market and on what term the need for supervision be manifest thus the court hold today that a state board on which a control number of decisionmaker be active market participant in the occupation the board regulate must satisfy midcal active supervision requirement in order to invoke antitrust immunity the state argue that allow this ftc order to stand will discourage dedicated citizen from serve on state agency that regulate they own occupation but this holding be not inconsistent with the idea that those who pursue a call must embrace ethical standard that derive from a duty separate from the dictate of the state further this case do not offer occasion to address the question whether agency official include board member may under some circumstance enjoy immunity from damages liability of course states may provide for the defense and indemnification of agency member in the event of litigation and they can also ensure parker immunity be available by adopt clear policy to displace competition and provide active supervision argument against the wisdom of apply the antitrust law to professional regulation absent compliance with the prerequisite for invoke parker immunity must be reject see patrick burget particularly in light of the risk licensing board dominate by market participant may pose to the free market the board do not contend in this court that its anticompetitive conduct be actively supervise by the state or that it should receive parker immunity on that basis the act delegate control over the practice of dentistry to the board but say nothing about tooth whitening in act to expel the dentist competitor from the market the board rely on letter threaten criminal liability instead of other power at its disposal that would have invoke oversight by a politically accountable official whether or not the board exceed its power under north carolina law there be no evidence of any decision by the state to initiate or concur with the board action against the nondentist c here where there be no specific supervisory system to be review it suffice to note that the inquiry regard active supervision be flexible and the question be whether the state review mechanism provide realistic assurance that a nonsovereign actor anticompetitive conduct promote state policy rather than merely the party individual interest patrick the court have identify only a few constant requirement of active supervision the supervisor must review the substance of the anticompetitive decision see at the supervisor must have the power to veto or modify particular decision to ensure they accord with state policy see and the mere potential for state supervision be not a adequate substitute for a decision by the state ticor supra at further the state supervisor may not itself be a active market participant in general however the adequacy of supervision otherwise will depend on all the circumstance of a case affirm kennedy deliver the opinion of the court in which roberts and ginsburg breyer sotomayor and kagan join alito file a dissenting opinion in which scalia and thomas join

dental examiners petitioner federal trade commission on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the fourth circuit february justice kennedy deliver the opinion of the court this case arise from a antitrust challenge to the action of a state regulatory board a majority of the board member be engage in the active practice of the profession it regulate the question be whether the board action be protect from sherman act regulation under the doctrine of antitrust immunity as define and apply in this court decision begin with parker brown i a in its dental practice act act north carolina have declare the practice of dentistry to be a matter of public concern require regulation stat ann a under the act the north carolina state board of dental examiner board be the agency of the state for the regulation of the practice of dentistry b the board principal duty be to create administer and enforce a licensing system for dentist see to to perform that function it have broad authority over licensee see the board authority with respect to unlicensed person however be more restricted like any resident citizen the board may file suit to perpetually enjoin any person from unlawfully practice dentistry the act provide that six of the board eight member must be license dentist engage in the active practice of dentistry they be elect by other licensed dentist in north carolina who cast they ballot in election conduct by the board ibid the seventh member must be a licensed and practice dental hygienist and he or she be elect by other licensed hygienist ibid the final member be refer to by the act as a consumer and be appoint by the governor ibid all member serve term and no person may serve more than two consecutive term ibid the act do not create any mechanism for the removal of a elect member of the board by a public official see ibid board member swear a oath of office a and the board must comply with the state administrative procedure act et public records act et and law et the board may promulgate rule and regulation govern the practice of dentistry within the state provide those mandate be not inconsistent with the act and be approve by the north carolina rules review commission whose member be appoint by the state legislature see a b in the dentist in north carolina start whitening tooth many of those who do so include of the board member during the period at issue in this case earn substantial fee for that service by nondentist arrive on the scene they charge lower price for they service than the dentist do dentist soon begin to complain to the board about they new competitor few complaint warn of possible harm to consumer most express a principal concern with the low price charge by nondentist respond to these filings the board open a investigation into nondentist tooth whitening a dentist member be place in charge of the inquiry neither the board hygienist member nor its consumer member participate in this undertaking the board chief operation officer remark that the board be go forth to do battle with nondentist app to pet for cert the board concern do not result in a formal rule or regulation reviewable by the independent rules review commission even though the act do not by its term specify that tooth whitening be the practice of dentistry start in the board issue at least letter on its official letterhead to nondentist tooth whitening service provider and product manufacturer many of those letter direct the recipient to cease all activity constitute the practice of dentistry warn that the unlicensed practice of dentistry be a crime and strongly imply or expressly state that tooth whitening constitute the practice of dentistry app in early the board persuade the north carolina board of cosmetic art examiner to warn cosmetologist against provide tooth whitening service later that year the board send letter to mall operator state that kiosk tooth whitener be violate the dental practice act and advise that the mall consider expel violator from they premise these action have the intended result nondentist cease offer tooth whitening service in north carolina c in the federal trade commission ftc file a administrative complaint charge the board with violate of the federal trade commission act stat as amend the ftc allege that the board concerted action to exclude nondentist from the market for tooth whitening service in north carolina constitute a anticompetitive and unfair method of competition the board move to dismiss allege immunity a administrative law judge alj deny the motion on appeal the ftc sustain the alj ruling it reason that even assume the board have act pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy to displace competition the board be a hybrid that must be actively supervise by the state to claim immunity app to pet for cert the ftc further conclude the board could not make that showing follow other proceedings not relevant here the alj conduct a hearing on the merit and determine the board have unreasonably restrained trade in violation of antitrust law on appeal the ftc again sustain the alj the ftc reject the board public safety justification note inter alia a wealth of evidence suggest that provide tooth whitening be a safe cosmetic procedure at the ftc order the board to stop send the letter or other communication that state nondentist may not offer tooth whiten service and product it further order the board to issue notice to all earlier recipient of the board order advise they of the board proper sphere of authority and say among other option that the notice recipient have a right to seek declaratory ruling in state court on petition for review the court of appeals for the fourth circuit affirm the ftc in all respects this court grant certiorari ii federal antitrust law be a central safeguard for the nation free market structure in this regard it be as important to the preservation of economic freedom and we system as the bill of rights be to the protection of we fundamental personal freedom united states topco associates the antitrust law declare a consider and decisive prohibition by the federal government of cartel price fix and other combination or practice that undermine the free market the sherman act stat as amend et serve to promote robust competition which in turn empower the states and provide they citizen with opportunity to pursue they own and the public welfare see ftc ticor title ins the states however when act in they respective realm need not adhere in all context to a model of unfettered competition while the states regulate they economy in many way not inconsistent with the antitrust law at in some sphere they impose restriction on occupation confer exclusive or shared rights to dominate a market or otherwise limit competition to achieve public objective if every duly enact state law or policy be require to conform to the mandate of the sherman act thus promote competition at the expense of other value a state may deem fundamental federal antitrust law would impose a impermissible burden on the states power to regulate see exxon governor of maryland see also easterbrook antitrust and the economics of federalism law econ for these reason the court in parker brown interpret the antitrust law to confer immunity on anticompetitive conduct by the states when act in they sovereign capacity see at that ruling recognize congress purpose to respect the federal balance and to embody in the sherman act the federalism principle that the states possess a significant measure of sovereignty under we constitution community communications boulder since the court have reaffirm the importance of parker central holding see ticor supra at hoover ronwin lafayette louisiana power light iii in this case the board argue its member be invest by north carolina with the power of the state and that as a result the board action be cloak with parker immunity this argument fail however a nonsovereign actor control by active market participant such as the board enjoy parker immunity only if it satisfy two requirement first that the challenge restraint be one clearly articulate and affirmatively express as state policy and second that the policy be actively supervise by the state ftc phoebe putney health system slip at quote california retail liquor dealers midcal aluminum the party have assume that the clear articulation requirement be satisfied and we do the same while north carolina prohibit the unauthorized practice of dentistry however its act be silent on whether that broad prohibition cover tooth whitening here the board do not receive active by the state when it interpret the act as tooth whitening and when it enforce that policy by issue letter to nondentist tooth whitener a although immunity exist to avoid conflict between state sovereignty and the nation commitment to a policy of robust competition parker immunity be not unbounded g iven the fundamental national value of free enterprise and economic competition that be embody in the federal antitrust law state action immunity be disfavor much as be repeal by implication phoebe putney supra at slip at quote ticor supra at a entity may not invoke parker immunity unless the action in question be a exercise of the state sovereign power see columbia omni outdoor advertising state legislation and decision s of a state supreme court act legislatively rather than judicially will satisfy this standard and ipso facto be exempt from the operation of the antitrust law because they be a undoubted exercise of state sovereign authority hoover supra at but while the sherman act confer immunity on the states own anticompetitive policy out of respect for federalism it do not always confer immunity where as here a state delegate control over a market to a actor see parker supra at a state do not give immunity to those who violate the sherman act by authorize they to violate it or by declare that they action be lawful for purpose of parker a nonsovereign actor be one whose conduct do not automatically qualify as that of the sovereign state itself see hoover supra at state agency be not simply by they governmental character sovereign actor for purpose of immunity see goldfarb virginia state bar the fact that the state bar be a state agency for some limited purpose do not create a antitrust shield that allow it to foster anticompetitive practice for the benefit of its member immunity for state agency therefore require more than a mere facade of state involvement for it be necessary in light of parker rationale to ensure the states accept political accountability for anticompetitive conduct they permit and control see ticor at limit on immunity be most essential when the state seek to delegate its regulatory power to active market participant for establish ethical standard may blend with private anticompetitive motive in a way difficult even for market participant to discern dual allegiance be not always apparent to a actor in consequence active market participant can not be allow to regulate they own market free from antitrust see midcal supra at the national policy in favor of competition can not be thwart by cast a gauzy cloak of state involvement over what be essentially a private arrangement indeed prohibition against anticompetitive by active market participant be a axiom of federal antitrust policy see allied tube conduit indian head hoover supra at stevens dissent the risk that private regulation of market entry price or output may be design to confer profit on member of a industry at the expense of the consuming public have be the central concern of we antitrust jurisprudence see also elhauge the scope of antitrust process harv so it follow that under parker and the supremacy clause the states greater power to attain a end do not include the lesser power to negate the congressional judgment embody in the sherman act through unsupervised delegation to active market participant see garland antitrust and state action economic efficiency and the political process yale parker immunity require that the anticompetitive conduct of nonsovereign actor especially those authorize by the state to regulate they own profession result from procedure that suffice to make it the state own see goldfarb supra at see also areeda hovencamp antitrust law ed areeda hovencamp the question be not whether the challenge conduct be efficient or wise see ticor supra at rather it be whether anticompetitive conduct engage in by nonsovereign actor should be deem state action and thus shield from the antitrust law patrick burget to answer this question the court apply the test set forth in california retail liquor dealers midcal aluminum a case arise from california delegation of authority to wine merchant under midcal a state law or regulatory scheme can not be the basis for antitrust immunity unless first the state have articulate a clear policy to allow the anticompetitive conduct and second the state provide active supervision of the anticompetitive conduct ticor supra at cite midcal supra at midcal clear articulation requirement be satisfied where the displacement of competition be the inherent logical or ordinary result of the exercise of authority delegate by the state legislature in that scenario the state must have foresee and implicitly endorse the anticompetitive effect as consistent with its policy goal phoebe putney at slip at the active supervision requirement demand inter alia that state official have and exercise power to review particular anticompetitive act of private party and disapprove those that fail to accord with state policy patrick supra at the two requirement set forth in midcal provide a proper analytical framework to resolve the ultimate question whether a anticompetitive policy be indeed the policy of a state the first requirement clear articulation rarely will achieve that goal by itself for a policy may satisfy this test yet still be define at so high a level of generality as to leave open critical question about how and to what extent the market should be regulate see ticor supra at entity purport to act under state authority might diverge from the state consider definition of the public good the result asymmetry between a state policy and its implementation can invite private the second midcal requirement active supervision seek to avoid this harm by require the state to review and approve interstitial policy make by the entity claim immunity midcal supervision rule stem from the recognition that w here a private party be engage in anticompetitive activity there be a real danger that he be act to further he own interest rather than the governmental interest of the state patrick supra at concern about the private incentive of active market participant animate midcal supervision mandate which demand realistic assurance that a private party anticompetitive conduct promote state policy rather than merely the party individual interest patrick supra at b in determine whether anticompetitive policy and conduct be indeed the action of a state in its sovereign capacity there be instance in which a actor can be excuse from midcal active supervision requirement in hallie eau claire the court hold municipality be subject exclusively to midcal clear articulation requirement that rule the court observe be consistent with the objective of ensure that the policy at issue be one enact by the state itself hallie explain that w here the actor be a municipality there be little or no danger that it be involve in a private arrangement the only real danger be that it will seek to further purely parochial public interest at the expense of more overriding state goal at hallie further observe that municipality be electorally accountable and lack the kind of private incentive characteristic of active participant in the market see at critically the municipality in hallie exercise a wide range of governmental power across different economic sphere substantially reduce the risk that it would pursue private interest while regulate any single field see ibid that hallie excuse municipality from midcal supervision rule for these reason all but confirm the rule applicability to actor control by active market participant who ordinarily have none of the feature justify the narrow exception hallie identify see at follow goldfarb midcal and hallie which clarify the condition under which parker immunity attach to the conduct of a nonsovereign actor the court in columbia omni outdoor advertising address whether a otherwise immune entity could lose immunity for conspire with private party in omni a aspiring billboard merchant argue that the city of columbia south carolina have violate the sherman act and forfeit its parker immunity by anticompetitively conspire with a established local company in pass a ordinance restrict new billboard construction at the court disagree hold there be no conspiracy exception to parker omni supra at omni like the case before it recognize the importance of draw a line relevant to the purpose of the sherman act and of parker prohibit the restriction of competition for private gain but permit the restriction of competition in the public interest at in the context of a municipal actor which as in hallie exercise substantial governmental power omni reject a conspiracy exception for corruption as vague and unworkable since virtually all regulation benefit some segment of the society and harm other and may in that sense be see as corrupt at omni also reject subjective test for corruption that would force a deconstruction of the governmental process and probe of the official intent that we have consistently seek to avoid ibid thus whereas the case precede it address the precondition of parker immunity and engage in a objective ex ante inquiry into nonsovereign actor structure and incentive omni make clear that recipient of immunity will not lose it on the basis of ad hoc and ex post question of they motive for make particular decision omni hold make it all the more necessary to ensure the condition for grant immunity be meet in the first place the court two immunity case decide after omni reinforce this point in ticor the court affirm that midcal limit on delegation must ensure that a ctual state involvement not deference to private arrangement under the general auspices of state law be the precondition for immunity from federal law at and in phoebe putney the court observe that midcal active supervision requirement in particular be a essential condition of immunity when a nonsovereign actor have a incentive to pursue its own under the guise of implement state policy at slip at quote hallie supra at the lesson be clear midcal active supervision test be a essential prerequisite of parker immunity for any nonsovereign entity public or private control by active market participant c the board argue entity designate by the states as agency be exempt from midcal second requirement that premise however can not be reconcile with the court repeat conclusion that the need for supervision turn not on the formal designation give by states to regulator but on the risk that active market participant will pursue private interest in restrain trade state agency control by active market participant who possess singularly strong private interest pose the very risk of midcal supervision requirement be create to address see areeda hovencamp at this conclusion do not question the good faith of state officer but rather be a assessment of the structural risk of market participant confuse they own interest with the state policy goal see patrick at the court apply this reasoning to a state agency in goldfarb there the court deny immunity to a state agency the virginia state bar control by market participant lawyer because the agency have join in what be essentially a private anticompetitive activity for the benefit of its member at this emphasis on the bar private interest explain why goldfarb though it predate midcal consider the lack of supervision by the virginia supreme court to be a principal reason for deny immunity see at see also hoover at emphasize lack of active supervision in goldfarb bates state bar of grant the arizona bar immunity partly because its rule be subject to pointed by the policymaker while hallie state it be likely that active state supervision would also not be require for agency at the entity there as be later the case in omni be a electorally accountable municipality with general regulatory power and no private agenda in that and other respects the municipality be more like prototypical state agency not specialize board dominate by active market participant in important regard agency control by market participant be more similar to private trade association vest by states with regulatory authority than to the agency hallie consider and as the court observe three year after hallie t here be no doubt that the member of such association often have economic incentive to restrain competition and that the product standard set by such association have a serious potential for anticompetitive harm allied tube at for that reason those association must satisfy midcal active supervision standard see midcal at the similarity between agency control by active market participant and private trade association be not eliminate simply because the former be give a formal designation by the state vest with a measure of government power and require to follow some procedural rule see hallie supra at reject purely formalistic analysis parker immunity do not derive from nomenclature alone when a state empower a group of active market participant to decide who can participate in its market and on what term the need for supervision be manifest see areeda hovencamp at the court hold today that a state board on which a control number of decisionmaker be active market participant in the occupation the board regulate must satisfy midcal active supervision requirement in order to invoke antitrust immunity d the state argue that allow this ftc order to stand will discourage dedicated citizen from serve on state agency that regulate they own occupation if this be so and for reason to be note it need not be so there would be some cause for concern the states have a sovereign interest in structure they government see gregory ashcroft and may conclude there be substantial benefit to staffing they agency with expert in complex and technical subject see southern motor carriers rate conference united states there be moreover a long tradition of citizen esteem by they professional colleague devote time energy and talent to enhance the dignity of they calling adherence to the idea that those who pursue a call must embrace ethical standard that derive from a duty separate from the dictate of the state reach back at least to the hippocratic oath see generally miles the hippocratic oath and the ethic of medicine in the united states there be a strong tradition of professional particularly with respect to the development of ethical rule see generally rotunda dzienkowski legal ethics the lawyer deskbook on professional responsibility baker before bioethic a history of american medical ethics from the colonial period to the bioethics revolution dentist be no exception the american dental association for example in a exercise of the privilege and obligation of have call ed upon dentist to follow high ethical standard include honesty compassion kindness integrity fairness and charity american dental association principle of ethic and code of professional conduct state law and institution be sustain by this tradition when they draw upon the expertise and commitment of professional today holding be not inconsistent with that idea the board argue however that the potential for money damages will discourage member of regulate occupation from participate in state government filarsky delia slip at warning in the context of civil rights suit that the the most talented candidate will decline public engagement if they do not receive the same immunity enjoy by they public employee counterpart but this case which do not present a claim for money damages do not offer occasion to address the question whether agency official include board member may under some circumstance enjoy immunity from damages liability see goldfarb at see also brief for respondent and of course the states may provide for the defense and indemnification of agency member in the event of litigation states furthermore can ensure parker immunity be available to agency by adopt clear policy to displace competition and if agency control by active market participant interpret or enforce those policy the states may provide active supervision precedent confirm this principle the court have reject the argument that it would be unwise to apply the antitrust law to professional regulation absent compliance with the prerequisite for invoke parker immunity respondent contend that effective peer review be essential to the provision of quality medical care and that any threat of antitrust liability will prevent physician from participate openly and actively in proceedings this argument however essentially challenge the wisdom of apply the antitrust law to the sphere of medical care and as such be properly direct to the legislative branch to the extent that congress have decline to exempt medical peer review from the reach of the antitrust law peer review be immune from antitrust scrutiny only if the state effectively have make this conduct its own patrick at footnote omit the reasoning of patrick burget apply to this case with full force particularly in light of the risk licensing board dominate by market participant may pose to the free market see generally edlin haw cartels by another name should license occupation face antitrust scrutiny e the board do not contend in this court that its anticompetitive conduct be actively supervise by the state or that it should receive parker immunity on that basis by statute north carolina delegate control over the practice of dentistry to the board the act however say nothing about tooth whitening a practice that do not exist when it be pass after receive complaint from other dentist about the nondentist cheaper service the board dentist member some of whom offer whitening service act to expel the dentist competitor from the market in so do the board rely upon letter threaten criminal liability rather than any of the power at its disposal that would invoke oversight by a politically accountable official with no active supervision by the state north carolina official may well have be unaware that the board have decide tooth whitening constitute the practice of dentistry and seek to prohibit those who compete against dentist from participate in the tooth whitening market whether or not the board exceed its power under north carolina law omni at there be no evidence here of any decision by the state to initiate or concur with the board action against the nondentist iv the board do not claim that the state exercise active or indeed any supervision over its conduct regard nondentist tooth whitener and as a result no specific supervisory system can be review here it suffice to note that the inquiry regard active supervision be flexible and active supervision need not entail involvement in a agency operation or micromanagement of its every decision rather the question be whether the state review mechanism provide realistic assurance that a nonsovereign actor anticompetitive conduct promote state policy rather than merely the party individual interest patrick supra at see also ticor at the court have identify only a few constant requirement of active supervision the supervisor must review the substance of the anticompetitive decision not merely the procedure follow to produce it see patrick at the supervisor must have the power to veto or modify particular decision to ensure they accord with state policy see and the mere potential for state supervision be not a adequate substitute for a decision by the state ticor supra at further the state supervisor may not itself be a active market participant in general however the adequacy of supervision otherwise will depend on all the circumstance of a case the sherman act protect competition while also respect federalism it do not authorize the states to abandon market to the unsupervised control of active market participant whether trade association or hybrid agency if a state want to rely on active market participant as regulator it must provide active supervision if immunity under parker be to be invoke the judgment of the court of appeals for the fourth circuit be affirm it be so order alito dissent north carolina state board of dental examiners petitioner federal trade commission on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the fourth circuit february justice alito with whom justice scalia and justice thomas join dissent the court decision in this case be base on a serious misunderstanding of the doctrine of antitrust immunity that this court recognize more than year ago in parker brown in parker the court hold that the sherman act do not prevent the states from continue they practice of enact measure such as licensing requirement that be design to protect the public health and welfare at the case now before we involve precisely this type of state regulation north carolina law govern the practice of dentistry which be administer by the north carolina board of dental examiner board today however the court take the unprecedented step of hold that parker do not apply to the north board because the board be not structure in a way that merit a seal of approval that be it be make up of practice dentist who have a financial incentive to use the licensing law to further the financial interest of the state dentist there be nothing new about the structure of the north carolina board when the states first create medical and dental board well before the sherman act be enact they begin to staffthem in this way nor be there anything new about the suspicion that the north carolina board in attempt to prevent person other than dentist from perform procedure be serve the interest of dentist and not the public professional and occupational licensing requirement have often be use in such a way but that be not what parker immunity be about indeed the very state program involve in that case be unquestionably design to benefit the regulate entity california raisin grower the question before we be not whether such program serve the public interest the question instead be whether this case be control by parker and the answer to that question be clear under parker the sherman act and the federal trade commission act see ftc ticor title ins do not apply to state agency the north carolina board of dental examiner be a state agency and that be the end of the matter by stray from this simple path the court have not only distorted parker it have head into a morass determine whether a state agency be structure in a way that militate against regulatory capture be no easy task and there be reason to fear that today decision will spawn confusion the court have veer off course and therefore i can not go along i in order to understand the nature of parker immunity it be helpful to recall the constitutional landscape in when the sherman act be enact at that time this court and congress have a understanding of the scope of federal and state power that be very different from we understanding today the states be understand to possess the exclusive authority to regulate they purely internal affair leisy hardin in exercise they police power in this area the states have long enact measure such as price control and licensing requirement that have the effect of restrain trade the sherman act be enact pursuant to congress power to regulate interstate commerce and in pass the act congress want to exercise that power to the utmost extent united states underwriters but in the understanding of the commerce power be far more limited than it be today see kidd pearson as a result the act do not pose a threat to traditional state regulatory activity by when parker be decide however the situation have change dramatically this court have hold that the commerce power permit congress to regulate even local activity if it exert a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce wickard filburn this mean that congress could regulate many of the matter that have once be think to fall exclusively within the jurisdiction of the states the new interpretation of the commerce power bring about a expansion of the reach of the sherman act see hospitalbuilding trustees of rex hospital d ecision by this court have permit the reach of the sherman act to expand along with expand notion of congressional power and the expand reach of the sherman act raise a important question the sherman act do not expressly exempt states from its scope do that mean that the act apply to the states and that it potentially outlaw many traditional state regulatory measure the court confront that question in parker in parker a raisin producer challenge the california agricultural prorate act a agricultural price support program the california act authorize the creation of a agricultural prorate advisory commission commission to establish marketing plan for certain agricultural commodity within the state at raisin be among the regulate commodity and so the commission establish a marketing program that govern many aspect of raisin sale include the quality and quantity of raisin sell the timing of sale and the price at which raisin be sell at the parker court assume that this program would have violate the sherman act if it be organize and make effective solely by virtue of a contract combination or conspiracy of private person and the court also assume that congress could have prohibit a state from create a program like california if it have choose to do so at nevertheless the court conclude that the california program do not violate the sherman act because the act do not circumscribe state regulatory power at the court holding in parker be not base on either the language of the sherman act or anything in the legislative history affirmatively show that the act be not mean to apply to the states instead the court reason that i n a dual system of government in which under the constitution the state be sovereign save only as may constitutionally subtract from they authority a unexpressed purpose to nullify a state control over its officer and agent be not lightly to be attribute to congress at for the congress that enact the sherman act in it would have be a truly radical and almost certainly futile step to attempt to prevent the states from exercise they traditional regulatory authority and the parker court refuse to assume that the act be mean to have such a effect when the basis for the parker doctrine be understand the court error in this case be plain in the regulation of the practice of medicine and dentistry be regard as fall squarely within the states sovereign police power by that time many states have establish medical and dental board often staff by doctor or dentist and have give those board the authority to confer and revoke licens this be quintessential police power legislation and although state law be often challenge during that era under the doctrine of substantive due process the licensing of medical professional easily survive such assault just one year before the enactment of the sherman act in dent west this court reject such a challenge to a state law require all physician to obtain a certificate from the state board of health attesting to they qualification and in hawker new york the court reiterate that a lawspecify the qualification to practice medicine be clearly a proper exercise of the police power thus the north carolina statute establish and specify the power of the state board of dental examiner represent precisely the kind of state regulation that the parker exemption be mean to immunize ii as note above the only question in this case be whether the north carolina board of dental examiner be really a state agency and the answer to that question be clearly yes the north carolina legislature determine that the practice of dentistry affect s the public health safety and welfare of north carolina citizen and that therefore the profession should be subject to regulation and control in the public interest in order to ensure that only qualify person be permit to practice dentistry in the state stat ann a to further that end the legislature create the north carolina state board of dental examiner as the agency of the state for the regulation of the practice of dentistry in th e state b the legislature specify the membership of the board c it define the practice of dentistry b and it set out standard for licensing practitioner the legislature also set out standard under which the board can initiate disciplinary proceedings against licensee who engage in certain improper act a the legislature empower the board to maintain a action in the name of the state of north carolina to perpetually enjoin any person from unlawfully practice dentistry a it authorize the board to conduct investigation and to hire legalcounsel and the legislature make any notice or statement of charge against any licensee a public record under state law d g the legislature empower the board to enact rule and regulation govern the practice of dentistry within the state consistent with relevant statute it have require that any such rule be include in the board annual report which the board must file with the north carolina secretary of state the state attorney general and the legislature joint regulatory reform committee and if the board fail to file the require report state law demand that it be automatically suspend until it do so ibid as this regulatory regime demonstrate north board of dental examiner be unmistakably a state agency create by the state legislature to serve a prescribed regulatory purpose and to do so use the state power in cooperation with other arm of state government the board be not a private or nonsovereign entity that the state of north carolina have attempt to immunize from federal antitrust scrutiny parker make it clear that a state may not give immunity to those who violate the sherman act by authorize they to violate it or by declare that they action be lawful ante at quote parker at when the parker court disapprove of any such attempt it cite northern securities united states to show what it have in mind in that case the court hold that a state act of charter a corporation do not shield the corporation monopolize activity from federal antitrust law at nothing similar be involve here north carolina do not authorize a private entity to enter into a anticompetitive arrangement rather north carolina create a state agency and give that agency the power to regulate a parti
