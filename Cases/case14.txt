rule be not further define by the apa and its precise meaning be the source of much scholarly and judicial debate see generally pierce distinguishing legislative rule from interpretative rule admin manning nonlegislative rule geo we need not and do not wade into that debate here for we purpose it suffice to say that the critical feature of interpretive rule be that they be issue by a agency to advise the public of the agency construction of the statute and rule which it administer shalala guernsey memorial hospital internal quotation mark omit the absence of a obligation make the process of

generally meet the duty requirement for the administrative exception b the financial service example end with a caveat note that a employee whose primary duty be sell financial product do not qualify

department accordingly withdraw its opinion letter which it now view as rely on misleading assumption s and selective and narrow analysis of the exemption example in b at like the and opinion letter the administrator interpretation be issue without notice or a opportunity for comment c mba file a complaint in federal district court challenge the administrator interpretation mba contend that the document be inconsistent with the regulation it purported to interpret and thus arbitrary and capricious in violation of of the apa more pertinent to this case mba also argue that the administrator interpretation be procedurally invalid in light of the circuit decision in paralyzed veterans under the paralyzed veterans doctrine if a agency have give its regulation a definitive interpretation and later significantly revise that interpretation the agency have in effect amend its rule something it may not accomplish under the apa without notice and comment alaska professional hunters faa cadc three former officer beverly buck ryan henry and jerome nickols subsequently intervene in the case to defend the administrator interpretation the district court grant summary judgment to the department mortgage bankers solis supp dc though it accept the party characterization of the administrator interpretation as a interpretive rule at the district court determine that the paralyzed veterans doctrine be inapplicable because mba have fail to establish its reliance on the contrary interpretation express in the department opinion letter the administrator interpretation the district court further determine be fully support by the text of the flsa regulation the court accordingly hold that the interpretation be not arbitrary or capricious the circuit reverse mortgage bankers harris bind to the rule of paralyzed veterans by precedent the court of appeals reject the government call to abandon the doctrine at in the court view t he only question properly before it be whether the district court have err in require mba to prove that it rely on the department prior interpretation at explain that reliance be not a require element of the paralyzed veterans doctrine and note the department concession that a prior conflict interpretation of the regulation exist the circuit conclude that the administrator interpretation have to be vacate we grant certiorari and now reverse ii the paralyzed veterans doctrine be contrary to the clear text of the apa rulemaking provision and it improperly impose on agency a obligation beyond the maximum procedural requirement specify in the apa vermont yankee nuclear power natural resources defense council a the text of the apa answer the question present section of the apa provide that notice of propose rule make shall be publish in the federal register b when such notice be require by the apa the agency shall give interested person a opportunity to participate in the rule making c but further state that unless notice or hearing be require by statute the act requirement do not apply to interpretative rule b a this exemption of interpretive rule from the process be categorical and it be fatal to the rule announce in paralyzed veterans rather than examine the exemption for interpretive rule contain in b a of the apa the circuit in paralyzed veterans focus its attention on of the act that section define rule making to include not only the initial issuance of new rule but also repeal s or amend ment of exist rule see because requirement may apply even to these later agency action the court reason allow ing a agency to make a fundamental change in its interpretation of a substantive regulation without notice and comment would undermine the apa procedural framework at this reading of the apa conflate the differ purpose of and of the act section define what a rulemaking be it do not however say what procedure a agency must use when it engage in rulemaking that be the purpose of and specifically exempt interpretive rule from the requirement that apply to legislative rule so the circuit correctly read of the apa to mandate that agency use the same procedure when they amend or repeal a rule as they use to issue the rule in the first instance see fcc fox television stations the apa make s no distinction between initial agency action and subsequent agency action undoing or revise that action where the court go wrong be in fail to apply that accurate understanding of to the exemption for interpretive rule contain in because a agency be not require to use procedure to issue a initial interpretive rule it be also not require to use those procedure when it amend or repeal that interpretive rule b the straightforward reading of the apa we now adopt harmonize with longstanding principle of we administrative law jurisprudence time and again we have reiterate that the apa set forth the full extent of judicial authority to review executive agency action for procedural correctness fox television stations at beyond the apa minimum requirement court lack authority to impose upon a agency its own notion of which procedure be best or most likely to further some vague undefined public good vermont yankee at to do otherwise would violate the very basic tenet of administrative law that agency should be free to fashion they own rule of procedure at these foundational principle apply with equal force to the apa procedure for rulemake we explain in vermont yankee that of the act establish the maximum procedural requirement which congress be willing to have the court impose upon agency in conduct rulemake procedure at agencies be free to grant additional procedural rights in the exercise of they discretion but review court be generally not free to impose they if the agency have not choose to grant they ibid the paralyzed veterans doctrine create just such a procedural right the right to notice and a opportunity to comment when a agency change its interpretation of one of the regulation it enforce that requirement may be wise policy or it may not regardless impose such a obligation be the responsibility of congress or the administrative agency not the court we trust that congress weigh the cost and benefit of place more rigorous procedural restriction on the issuance of interpretive rule see at when congress enact the apa it settle and contention and enact ed a formula upon which oppose social and political force have come to rest internal quotation mark omit in the end congress decide to adopt standard that permit agency to promulgate freely such rule whether or not they be consistent with earlier interpretation that the circuit would have strike the balance differently do not permit that court or this one to overturn congress contrary judgment law siegel slip at iii mba offer several reason why the paralyzed veterans doctrine should be uphold they be not persuasive a mba begin its defense of the paralyzed veterans doctrine by attempt to bolster the circuit reading of the apa paralyze veterans mba contend simply acknowledge the reality that where a agency significantly alter a prior definitive interpretation of a regulation it have effectively amend the regulation itself something that under the apa require use of procedure brief for respondent the act of amend however in both ordinary parlance and legal usage have its own meaning separate and apart from the act of interpret compare black law dictionary ed define amend as t o change the wording of or formally alter by strike out insert or substitute word with at define interpret as t o ascertain the meaning and significance of thought express in word one would not normally say that a court amends a statute when it interpret its text so too can a agency interpret a regulation without effectively amend ing the underlie source of law mba do not explain how precisely a interpretive rule change the regulation it interpret and its assertion be impossible to reconcile with the longstanding recognition that interpretive rule do not have the force and effect of law see chrysler at cite attorney general manual on the administrative procedure act skidmore swift mba theory be particularly odd in light of the limitation of the paralyzed veterans doctrine recall that the rule of paralyzed veterans apply only when a agency have previously adopt a interpretation of its regulation yet in that initial interpretation as much as all that come after the agency be give a definite meaning to a ambiguous text the very act mba insist require notice and comment mba be unable to say why its argument regard revise interpretation should not also extend to the agency first interpretation next mba argue that the paralyzed veterans doctrine be more consistent with this court functional approach to interpret the apa rely on christensen harris county and shalala guernsey memorial hospital mba contend that we have already recognize that a agency may not avoid procedure by cloak its action in the mantle of mere interpretation brief for respondent neither of the case mba cite support its argument we decision in christensen do not address a change in agency interpretation instead we there refuse to give deference to a agency interpretation of a unambiguous regulation observe that to defer in such a case would allow the agency to create de facto a new regulation at put differently christensen hold that the agency interpretation at issue be substantively invalid because it conflict with the text of the regulation the agency purported to interpret that holding be irrelevant to this suit and to the paralyzed veterans rule which assess whether a agency interpretation be procedurally invalid as for guernsey that case be fully consistent with indeed confirm what the text of the apa make plain interpretive rule do not require notice and comment at sidestep this inconvenient language mba instead quote a portion of the court opinion state that apa rulemaking would still be require if a agency adopt a new position inconsistent with exist regulation at but the statement on which mba rely be dictum worse it be dictum take out of context the regulation to which the court refer be two provision of the medicare reimbursement scheme and it be apparent from the court description of these regulation in part ii of the opinion that they be legislative rule issue through the process see at note that the dispute regulation be codify in the code of federal regulations read properly then the cite passage from guernsey merely mean that a agency may only change its interpretation if the revise interpretation be consistent with the underlie regulation brief for petitioner in b in the main mba attempt to justify the paralyzed veterans doctrine on practical and policy grounds mba contend that the doctrine reinforce the apa goal of procedural fairness by prevent agency from unilaterally and unexpectedly alter they interpretation of important regulation brief for respondent there may be time when a agency decision to issue a interpretive rule rather than a legislative rule be drive primarily by a desire to skirt provision but regulate entity be not without recourse in such situation quite the opposite the apa contain a variety of constraint on agency decisionmaking the arbitrary and capricious standard be among the most notable as we hold in fox television stations and underscore again today the apa require a agency to provide more substantial justification when its new policy rest upon factual finding that contradict those which underlie its prior policy or when its prior policy have engender serious reliance interest that must be take into account it would be arbitrary and capricious to ignore such matter at citation omit see also at kennedy concur in part and concur in judgment in addition congress be aware that agency sometimes alter they view in way that upset settle reliance interest for that reason congress sometimes include in the statute it draft provision that shelter regulate entity from liability when they act in conformance with previous agency interpretation the flsa include one such provision as amend by the act of et the flsa provide that no employer shall be subject to any liability for fail to pay minimum wages or overtime compensation if it demonstrate that the act or omission complain of be in good faith in conformity with and in reliance on any write administrative regulation order ruling approval or interpretation of the administrator of the department wage and hour division even when the guidance be later modify or rescind a b these safe harbor will often protect party from liability when a agency adopt a interpretation that conflict with its previous position c mba change direction in the second half of its brief contend that if the court overturn the paralyzed veterans rule the circuit judgment should nonetheless be affirm that be so mba say because the agency interpretation at issue the administrator interpretation should in fact be classify as a legislative rule we will not address this argument from the beginning the party litigate this suit on the understanding that the administrator interpretation be as its name suggest a interpretive rule indeed if mba do not think the administrator interpretation be a interpretive rule then its decision to invoke the paralyzed veterans doctrine in attack the rule be pass strange after all paralyze veterans apply only to interpretive rule consequently neither the district court nor the circuit consider mba current claim that the administrator interpretation be actually a legislative rule beyond that and more important still mba brief in opposition to certiorari do not dispute petitioner assertion in they framing of the question present and in the substance of they petition that the administrator interpretation be a interpretive rule thus even assume mba do not waive the argument below it have do so in this court see this court rule carcieri salazar for the foregoing reason the judgment of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit be reverse it be so order opinion of alito and et al et et on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the district of columbia circuit march justice alito concur in part and concur in the judgment i join the opinion of the court except for part i agree that the doctrine of paralyzed veterans of america arena cadc be incompatible with the administrative procedure act the creation of that doctrine may have be prompt by a understandable concern about the aggrandizement of the power of administrative agency as a result of the combined effect of the effective delegation to agency by congress of huge swath of lawmaking authority the exploitation by agency of the uncertain boundary between legislative and interpretive rule and this court case hold that court must ordinarily defer to a agency interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation see bowles seminole rock sand i do not dismiss these concern but the paralyzed veterans doctrine be not a viable cure for these problem at least one of the three factor note above however concern a matter that can be address by this court the opinion of justice scalia and justice thomas offer substantial reason why the seminole rock doctrine may be incorrect see also christopher smithkline beecham slip at cite inter alia manning constitutional structure and judicial deference to agency interpretations of agency rules colum i await a case in which the validity of seminole rock may be explore through full briefing and argument scalia concur in judgment and et al et et on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the district of columbia circuit march justice scalia concur in the judgment i agree with the court decision and all of its reasoning demonstrate the incompatibility of the circuit paralyzed veterans hold with the administrative procedure act paralyze veteran of be arena cadc i do not agree however with the court portrayal of the result it produce as a vindication of the balance congress strike when it weigh the cost and benefit of place more rigorous restriction on the issuance of interpretive rule ante at that depiction be accurate enough if one look at this case in isolation consider alongside we law of deference to administrative determination however today decision produce a balance between power and procedure quite different from the one congress choose when it enact the apa the apa be frame against a background of rapid expansion of the administrative process as a check upon administrator whose zeal might otherwise have carry they to excess not contemplate in legislation create they office united states morton salt the act guard against excess in rulemaking by require notice and comment before a agency make a rule it normally must notify the public of the proposal invite they to comment on its shortcoming consider and respond to they argument and explain its final decision in a statement of the rule basis and purpose b c ante at the apa exempt interpretive rule from these requirement b a but this concession to agency be mean to be more modest in its effect than it be today for despite exempt interpretive rule from notice and comment the act provide that the review court shall interpret constitutional and statutory provision and determine the meaning or applicability of the term of a agency action emphasis add the act thus contemplate that court not agency will authoritatively resolve ambiguity in statute and regulation in such a regime the exemption for interpretive rule do not add much to agency power a agency may use interpretive rule to advise the public by explain its interpretation of the law but a agency may not use interpretive rule to bind the public by make law because it remain the responsibility of the court to decide whether the law mean what the agency say it mean heedless of the original design of the apa we have develop a elaborate law of deference to agency interpretation of statute and regulation never mention directive that the review court interpret statutory provision we have hold that agency may authoritatively resolve ambiguity in statute chevron natural resources defense council and never mention directive that the review court determine the meaning or applicability of the term of a agency action we have rely on a case decide before the apa bowles seminole rock sand hold that agency may authoritatively resolve ambiguity in regulation auer robbins by supplement the apa with doctrine of deference we have revolutionize the import of interpretive rule exemption from rulemaking agencies may now use these rule not just to advise the public but also to bind they after all if a interpretive rule get deference the people be bind to obey it on pain of sanction no less surely than they be bind to obey substantive rule which be accord similar deference interpretive rule that command deference do have the force of law the court reason for resist this obvious point would not withstand a gentle breeze even when a agency interpretation get deference the court argue it be the court that ultimately decide whether the text mean what the agency say ante at that be not quite so so long as the agency do not stray beyond the ambiguity in the text be interpret deference compel the review court to decide that the text mean what the agency say the court continue that deference be not a inexorable command in all case because for example it do not apply to plainly erroneous interpretation ibid true but beside the point say all interpretive rule lack force of law because plainly erroneous interpretation do not bind court be like say all substantive rule lack force of law because arbitrary and capricious rule do not bind court of course a interpretive rule must meet certain condition before it get deference the interpretation must for instance be but once it do so it be every bit as binding as a substantive rule so the point stand by defer to interpretive rule we have allow agency to make binding rule unhamper by procedure the problem be bad enough and perhaps insoluble if chevron be not to be uproot with respect to interpretive rule set forth agency interpretation of statute but a agency interpretation of its own regulation be matter by give that category of interpretive rule auer deference we do more than allow the agency to make binding regulation without notice and comment because the agency not congress draft the substantive rule that be the object of those interpretation give they deference allow the agency to control the extent of its domain to expand this domain the agency need only write substantive rule more broadly and vaguely leave plenty of gap to be fill in later use interpretive rule unchecked by notice and comment the apa do not remotely contemplate this regime still and all what be we to do about the problem the paralyzed veterans doctrine be a courageous indeed brazen attempt to limit the mischief by require a interpretive rule to go through notice and comment if it revise a earlier definitive interpretation of a regulation that solution be unlawful for the reason set forth in the court opinion it contradict the apa unqualified exemption of interpretive rule from rulemaking but i think there be another solution one unavailable to the circuit since it involve the overrule of one this court decision that be even a greater fault than merely ignore the apa as i have describe elsewhere the rule of chevron if it do not comport with the apa at least be in conformity with the long history of judicial review of executive action where s tatutory ambiguity be leave to reasonable resolution by the executive united states mead scalia dissent i be unaware of any such history justify deference to agency interpretation of its own regulation and there be weighty reason to deny a lawgiver the power to write ambiguous law and then be the judge of what the ambiguity mean see decker northwest environmental defense center scalia concur in part and dissent in part slip at i would therefore restore the balance originally strike by the apa with respect to a agency interpretation of its own regulation not by rewrite the act in order to make up for auer but by abandon auer and apply the act as write the agency be free to interpret its own regulation with or without notice and comment but court will decide with no deference to the agency whether that interpretation be correct thomas concur in judgment and et al et et on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the district of columbia circuit march justice thomas concur in the judgment i concur in the court hold that the doctrine first announce in paralyzed veterans of america arena cadc be inconsistent with the administrative procedure act apa et and must be reject a agency substantial revision of its interpretation of a regulation do not amount to a amendment of the regulation as that word be use in the statute i write separately because these case call into question the legitimacy of we precedent require deference to administrative interpretation of regulation that line of precedent begin with bowles seminole rock sand require judge to defer to agency interpretation of regulation thus as happen in these case give legal effect to the interpretation rather than the regulation themselves because this doctrine effect a transfer of the judicial power to a executive agency it raise constitutional concern this line of precedent undermine we obligation to provide a judicial check on the other branch and it subject regulated party to precisely the abuse that the framers seek to prevent i the doctrine of deference to a agency interpretation of regulation be usually trace back to this court decision in seminole rock supra which involve the interpretation of a price control regulation at along with a general price freeze the administrator of the office of price administration have promulgate specialize regulation govern the maximum price for different commodity at when the administrator bring a enforcement action against a manufacturer of crushed stone the manufacturer challenge the administrator interpretation of he regulation the lower court agree with the manufacturer interpretation at but this court reverse in set out the approach it would apply to the case the court announce without citation or explanation that a administrative interpretation of a ambiguous regulation be entitle to control weight since this involve a interpretation of a administrative regulation a court must necessarily look to the administrative construction of the regulation if the meaning of the word use be in doubt the intention of congress or the principle of the constitution in some situation may be relevant in the first instance in choose between various construction but the ultimate criterion be the administrative interpretation which become of control weight unless it be plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation at the court then conclude that the rule clearly favor the administrator interpretation render this discussion dictum at from this unsupported rule develop a doctrine of deference that have take on a life of its own it have be broadly apply to regulation issue by agency across a broad spectrum of subject see robertson methow valley citizens council forest ehlert united states selective service ins stanisic deportation udall tallman oil and gas lease it have even be apply to a agency interpretation of another agency regulation see pauley bethenergy mines and it have be apply to a agency interpretation that be inconsistent with a previous interpretation of the same regulation see long island care at home coke it have be apply to formal and informal interpretation alike include those take during litigation see auer robbins its reasoning have also be extend outside the context of traditional agency regulation into the realm of criminal sentencing see stinson united states conclude that the sentence commission commentary on its guideline be analogous to a agency interpretation of its own regulation entitle to seminole rock deference the court have even apply the doctrine to a agency interpretation of a regulation cast in such vague aspirational term as to have no substantive content see thomas jefferson shalala see also at thomas dissent on this steady march toward deference the court only once expressly decline to apply seminole rock deference on the ground that the agency interpretation be plainly erroneous in that case we be face with the predictable consequence of this line of precedent a agency seek deference to a opinion letter that interpret a permissive regulation as mandatory see christensen harris county we reject that request for deference as a effort under the guise of interpret a regulation to create de facto a new regulation ibid this narrow limit on the broad deference give the agency interpretation though sound could not save a doctrine that be constitutionally infirm from the start seminole rock be constitutionally suspect from the start and this court repeat extension of it have only magnify the effect and the attendant concern ii we have not always be vigilant about protect the structure of we constitution although this court have repeatedly invoke the separation of power and the constitutional system of check and balance as core principle of we constitutional design essential to the protection of individual liberty see stern marshall slip at internal quotation mark omit it have also endorse a more pragmatic flexible approach to that design when it have seem more convenient to permit the power to be mixed see nixon administrator of general services as the history show that approach run the risk of compromise we constitutional structure a the constitution particular blend of separated power and check and balance be inform by century of political thought and experience see vile constitutionalism and the separation of powers ed vile though the theory of the separation of power and check and balance have root in the ancient world event of the and century play a crucial role in they development and inform the man who craft and ratify the constitution over a century before we war of independence the english civil war catapult the theory of the separation of power to prominence as political theorist of the day witness the conflict between the king and parliament and the danger of tyrannical government pose by each they begin to call for a clear division of authority between the two at a work title the royalist defence offer perhaps the first extended account of the theory of the separation of power w hilst the supreamacy the power to judge the law and authority to make new lawes be keep in severall hand the known law be preserve but unite it be vanish instantly thereupon and arbytrary and tyrannicall power be introduce the royalist defence italics in original john locke and baron de montesquieu endorse and expand on this concept see vile they agree with the general theory set forth in the royalist defence emphasize the need for a separation of power to protect individual liberty locke second treatise of civil government gough ed montesquieu spirit of the laws bk xi ch piest nugent transl but they also advocate a system of check and balance to reinforce that separation vile for instance they agree that the executive should have the power to assemble and dismiss the legislature and to consent to law pass by it see locke supra at montesquieu spirit of the laws at montesquieu warn that power should be a check to power lest the legislature arrogate to itself what authority it please and soon destroy all the other power at the experience of the states during the period between the war of independence and the ratification of the constitution confirm the wisdom of combine these theory although many state constitutions of the time include language unequivocally endorse the separation of power they do not secure that separation with check and balance vile and actively place traditional executive and judicial function in the legislature wood the creation of the american republic under these arrangement state legislature arrogate power to themselves and begin to confiscate property approve the printing of paper money and suspend the ordinary means for the recovery of debt at when the framers meet for the constitutional convention they understand the need for greater check and balance to reinforce the separation of power as madison remark experience have teach we a distrust of the separation of power alone as a sufficient security to each branch against encroachment of the other records of the federal convention of farrand i t be necessary to introduce such a balance of power and interest as will guarantee the provision on paper ibid the framers thus separate the three main power of government legislative executive and judicial into the three branch create by articles i ii and iii but they also create check and balance to reinforce that separation for example they give congress specific enumerated power to enact legislation art i but give the president the power to veto that legislation subject to congressional override by a supermajority vote art i cl they give the president the power to appoint principal officer of the united states but give the senate the power to give advice and consent to those appointment art ii cl they give the house and senate the power to agree to adjourn for more than three day art i cl but give the president the power in case of disagreement between they to adjourn the congress to such time as he shall think proper art ii cl during the ratification debate madison argue that this structure represent the great security for liberty in the constitution the federalist rossiter ed madison to the framers the separation of power and check and balance be more than just theory they be practical and real protection for individual liberty in the new constitution see mistretta united states scalia dissent the constitution be a prescribed structure a framework for the conduct of government in design that structure the framers themselves consider how much commingling of governmental power be in the generality of thing acceptable and set forth they conclusion in the document the judiciary no less than the other two branch have a obligation to guard against deviation from those principle the seminole rock line of precedent be one such deviation b seminole rock raise two related constitutional concern it represent a transfer of judicial power to the executive branch and it amount to a erosion of the judicial obligation to serve as a check on the political branch when a party properly bring a case or controversy to a article iii court that court be call upon to exercise the judicial power of the united states art iii for the reason i explain in this section the judicial power as originally understand require a court to exercise its independent judgment in interpret and expound upon the law those who ratify the constitution know that legal text would often contain ambiguity see generally molot the judicial perspective in the administrative state reconcile modern doctrine of deference with the judiciary structural role stan and nelson originalism and interpretive conventions chi as james madison explain all new law though pen with the greatest technical skill and pass on the fullest and most mature deliberation be consider as more or less obscure and equivocal the federalist at the judicial power be understand to include the power to resolve these ambiguity over time see ibid alexander hamilton laud this power argue that t he interpretation of the law be the proper and peculiar province of the court at it be undoubtedly true that the other branch of government have the authority and obligation to interpret the law but only the judicial interpretation would be consider authoritative in a judicial proceeding vile although the federalists and engage in a public debate about this interpretive power that debate center on the danger inherent in the power not on its allocation under the constitution see letter from the federal farmer xv in the complete storing ed argue that the interpretive power make the judiciary the most dangerous branch write as brutus one lead argue that judge w ould not confine themselves to any fix or establish rule but w ould determine accord to what appear to they the reason and spirit of the constitution essay of brutus in at the federalists reject these argument assure the public that judge would be guide by strict rule and precedent which serve to define and point out they duty in every particular case that come before they the federalist at hamilton those rule include principle of interpretation that have be set out by jurist for century see von pufendorf de officio hominis et civis juxta legem naturalem libri duo moore transl see also blackstone commentary on the law of england one of the key element of the federalists argument in support of the allocation of power to make binding interpretation of the law be that article iii judge would exercise independent judgment although judicial independence be often discuss in term of independence from external threat the framers understand the concept to also require independence from the internal threat of human will hamburger law and judicial duty see also the federalist at hamilton the judiciary may truly be say to have neither force nor will but merely judgment independent judgment require judge to decide case in accordance with the law of the land not in accordance with pressure place upon they through either internal or external source internal source might include personal bias while external source might include pressure from the political branch the public or other interested party see hamburger supra at the framer make several key decision at the convention with these pressure in mind for example they reject proposal to include a federal council of revision after several participant at the convention express concern that judicial involvement in such a council would foster internal bias rufus king of maryland for example assert that the judges ought to be able to expound the law as it should come before they free from the bias of have participate in its formation records of the federal convention of at alexander hamilton repeat these concern in the federalist argue that the judge who be to be interpreter of the law might receive a improper bias from have give a previous opinion in they revisionary capacity or be induce to embark too far in the political view of the executive from too much association with he the federalist at see also hamburger supra at the framers also create structural protection in the constitution to free judge from external influence they provide for example that judge should hold they office during good behaviour and receive a compensation which shall not be diminish during they continuance in office art iii hamilton note that such unequivocal language have be show necessary by the experience of the states where similar state constitutional protection for judge have not be sufficiently definite to preclude legislative evasion of the separation of the judicial power the federalist at because power over a man subsistence amount to a power over he will he argue that article iii structural protection would help ensure that judge fulfil they constitutional role ibid emphasis delete the framer make the opposite choice for legislator and the executive instead of insulate they from external pressure the constitution tie they to those pressure it provide for election of member of the house of representatives every two year art i cl and selection of member of the senate every six year art i cl it also provide for the president to be subject to election every four year art ii cl the president be thus directly dependent on the people and since there be only one president he be responsible the people know whom to blame see morrison olson scalia dissent to preserve that accountability we have hold that executive officer must be subject to removal by the president to ensure accountability within the executive branch see free enterprise fund public company accounting oversight see also morrison supra at opinion of scalia it be not for we to determine and we have never presume to determine how much of the purely executive power of government must be within the full control of the president the constitution prescribe that they all be give these structural distinction between the branch it be no surprise that judicial interpretation be definitive in case and controversy before the court court act as a intermediate body between the people and the legislature in order among other thing to keep the latter within the limit assign to they authority federalist at hamilton the legislature and executive may be sway by popular sentiment to abandon the stricture of the constitution or other rule of law but the judiciary insulate from both internal and external source of bias be duty bind to exercise independent judgment in apply the law interpret agency regulation call for that exercise of independent judgment substantive regulation have the force and effect of law see united states mead agencies and private party alike can use these regulation in proceedings against regulate party see christopher smithkline beecham slip at private party rely on department of labor regulation fcc fox television stations slip at agency issue notice of liability under regulation just as it be critical for judge to exercise independent judgment in apply statute it be critical for judge to exercise independent judgment in determine that a regulation properly cover the conduct of regulate party define the legal meaning of the regulation be one aspect of that determination seminole rock deference however preclude judge from independently determine that meaning rather than judge apply recognize tool of interpretation to determine the best meaning of a regulation this doctrine demand that court accord control weight to the agency interpretation of a regulation subject only to the narrow exception for interpretation that be plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation that deference amount to a transfer of the judge exercise of interpretive judgment to the agency see johnson dictionary of the english language ed define d efer as to leave to another judgment but the agency as part of the executive branch lack the structural protection for independent judgment adopt by the framers include the life tenure and salary protection of article iii because the agency be thus not properly constitute to exercise the judicial power under the constitution the transfer of interpretive judgment raise serious concern seminole rock be constitutionally questionable for a additional reason it undermine the judicial check on the political branch unlike the legislative and executive branches each of which possess several political check on the other the judiciary have one primary check on the excess of political branch that check be the enforcement of the rule of law through the exercise of judicial power judges have long recognize they responsibility to apply the law even if they do not conceive of it as a check on political power during the century for example king james i seek to pressure chief justice coke to affirm the lawfulness of he effort to raise revenue without the participation of parliament hamburger law and judicial duty at coke seek time to confer with he fellow jurist to make a advise answer accord to law and reason case of proclamation eng but the king representative lord chancellor ellesmere respond that he would advise the judges to maintain the power and prerogative of the king and suggest that in case in which there be no authority and precedent the judiciary should leave it to the king to order in it accord to he wisdom ibid coke famously respond t he king can not change any part of the common law nor create any offence by he proclamation which be not a offence before without parliament ibid when james i later attempt to do just that coke declare the proclamation utterly against law and reason and for that void hamburger supra at the framers expect article iii judge to engage in similar effort by apply the law as a check on the excess of both the legislative and executive branches see elliot debate in the several convention on the adoption of the federal constitution marshall if the government of the united states make a law not warrant by any of the power enumerate it would be consider by the judge as a infringement of the constitution which they be to guard they would declare it void see also vile the framer contemplated the constitution as a rule for the government of court as well as of the legislature marbury madison cranch thus if a case involve a conflict between a law and the constitution judge would have a duty to adhere to the latter and disregard the former the federalist at hamilton see also marbury cranch at similarly if a case involve a executive effort to extend a law beyond its meaning judge would have a duty to adhere to the law that have be properly promulgate under the constitution at consider the scope of the president constitutional power of appointment as this court say long ago t he particular phraseology of the constitution of the united states confirm and strengthen the principle suppose to be essential to all write constitution that a law repugnant to the constitution be void and that court as well as other department be bind by that instrument at article iii judge can not opt out of exercise they check as we have long recognize t he judiciary have a responsibility to decide case properly before it even those it would gladly avoid zivotofsky clinton slip at quote cohens virginia wheat this responsibility apply not only to constitutional challenge to particular statute see shelby county holder slip at include those base on the separation of power free enterprise fund at but also to more routine question about the best interpretation of statute see whitfield united states slip at or the compatibility of agency action with enable statute utility air regulatory group epa slip at in each case the judiciary be call upon to exercise its independent judgment and apply the law but we have not consistently exercise the judicial check with respect to administrative agency even though regulate party have repeatedly challenge agency interpretation as inconsistent with exist regulation we have just as repeatedly decline to exercise independent judgment as to those claim instead we have defer to the executive agency that both promulgate the regulation and enforce they although a agency interpretation of a regulation might be the best interpretation it also might not when court refuse even to decide what the best interpretation be under the law they abandon the judicial check that abandonment permit precisely the accumulation of governmental power that the framers warn against see the federalist at madison c this accumulation of governmental power allow agency to change the meaning of regulation at they discretion and without any advance notice to the party it be precisely this problem that the united states court of appeals for the circuit attempt to address by require agency to undertake notice and comment procedure before substantially revise definitive interpretation of regulation paralyze veterans supra though legally erroneous the court of appeals reasoning be practically sound when court give control weight to a administrative interpretation of a regulation instead of to the best interpretation of it they effectively give the interpretation and not the regulation the force and effect of law to regulate party the new interpretation might as well be a new regulation these case provide a classic example of the problem the fair labor standards act of establish federal minimum wage and overtime requirement but exempt from these requirement
