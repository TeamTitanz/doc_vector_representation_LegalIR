sturgeon be pilot he hovercraft over a stretch of the nation river that flow through the rivers national preserve a conservation system unit in alaska that be manage by the national park service alaska law permit the use of hovercraft national park service regulation do not see cfr e park service ranger approach sturgeon inform he that hovercraft be prohibit within the preserve under park

the boundary of the alaska intervene in support of sturgeon the secretary of the interior have authority to prescribe regulation concern boat and other activity on or relate to water located within system unit b the park service hovercraft regulation be adopt pursuant to section b the hovercraft ban be not limit to alaska but instead have effect in federally manage preservation area across the country section c of anilca in contrast address the scope of the park service authority over land within the boundary of conservation system unit in alaska the first sentence of section c specify the property include as a portion of those unit it state only those land within the boundary of any conservation system unit which be public land as such term be define in this act shall be deem to be include as a portion of such unit c anilca define the word land to include land water and interest therein and the term public land to include land to which the united states have title with certain exception the second sentence of section c concern the park service authority to regulate land in alaska which include state native corporation and private property it provide no land which before on or after december be convey to the state to any native corporation or to any private party shall be subject to the regulation applicable solely to public land within such unit c the third sentence of section c explain how new land become part of conservation system unit if the state a native corporation or other owner desire to convey any such land the secretary may acquire such land in accordance with applicable law include this act and any such land shall become part of the unit and be administer accordingly ibid interpret section c of anilca the district court grant summary judgment to the park service and the ninth circuit affirm in pertinent part accord to the ninth circuit because the hovercraft regulation apply to all land and water administer by the park service nationwide as well as all navigable water lie within national park the hovercraft ban do not apply solely within conservation system unit in alaska the ninth circuit conclude that the park service therefore have authority to enforce its hovercraft regulation on the nation river the ninth circuit do not address whether the nation river count as public land for purpose of anilca hold the ninth circuit interpretation of section c be inconsistent with both the text and context of anilca a the ninth circuit interpretation of section c violate a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the word of a statute must be read in they context and with a view to they place in the overall statutory scheme roberts services anilca repeatedly recognize that alaska be different and anilca itself accordingly carve out numerous exception to the park service general authority over federally manage preservation area those provision reflect the simple truth that alaska be often the exception not the rule yet the reading below would prevent the park service from recognize alaska unique condition under that reading the park service could regulate land in alaska only through rule applicable outside alaska as well the court conclude that whatever the reach of the park service authority under anilca section c do not adopt such a approach b moreover it be clear that section c draw a distinction between public and land within the boundary of conservation system unit in alaska and yet accord to the court below if the park service want to differentiate between that public and land in a way it would have to regulate the land pursuant to rule applicable outside alaska and the public land pursuant to provision assume the park service have authority over land in alaska a issue the court do not decide the court conclude that this be a implausible reading of the statute the court therefore reject the interpretation of section c adopt by the court below c the court do not reach the remainder of the party argument in particular it do not decide whether the nation river qualify as public land for purpose of anilca it also do not decide whether the park service have authority under section b to regulate sturgeon activity on the nation river even if the river be not public land or whether as sturgeon argue any such authority be limit by anilca finally the court do not consider whether the park service have authority under anilca over both public and land within the boundary of conservation system unit in alaska to the extent a regulation be write to apply specifically to both type of land the court leave those argument to the lower court for consideration as necessary vacate and remand roberts deliver the opinion for a unanimous court opinion of the
