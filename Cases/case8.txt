article ii of the constitution require that the president obtain the advice and consent of the senate before appoint officer of the united states cl give this provision the responsibility of a office require presidential appointment and senate confirmation pas office may go unperformed if a vacancy arise and the president and senate can not promptly agree on a replacement congress have account for this reality by give the president limited authority to appoint act official to temporarily perform the function of a vacant pas office without first obtain senate approval the current version of that authorization be the federal vacancy reform act of fvra section a of the fvra permit three category of government official to perform act service in a vacant pas office subsection a prescribe the general rule that if a vacancy arise in a pas office the first assistant to that office shall perform the office function and duty temporarily in a act capacity subsection a and a provide that notwithstanding paragraph the president may direct a person already serve in another pas office or a senior employee in the relevant agency to serve in a act capacity instead section also make certain individual ineligible for act service subsection b state notwithstanding subsection a a person may not serve as a act officer for a office under this section if the president nominate he for the vacant pas office and during the period precede the vacancy the person do not serve in the position of first assistant to that office or serve in that position for less than day the general counsel of the national labor relations board nlrb or the board be a pas office in june a vacancy arise in that office and the president direct lafe solomon to serve as act general counsel solomon qualify for act service under subsection a of the fvra because he be a senior employee at the nlrb in january the president nominate solomon to serve as the nlrb general counsel on a permanent basis the senate never take action on the nomination and the president ultimately withdraw solomon name in favor of a new candidate whom the senate confirm in october throughout this entire period solomon serve as the act general counsel to the nlrb in january a nlrb regional director exercise authority on solomon behalf issue a unfair labor practice complaint against respondent sw general a administrative law judge conclude that sw general have commit unfair labor practice and the nlrb agree sw general seek review in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit argue that the complaint be invalid because under subsection b of the fvra solomon could not perform the duty of general counsel to the nlrb after have be nominate to fill that position the nlrb counter that subsection b apply only to first assistant who automatically assume act duty under subsection a not to act officer who like solomon serve under a or a the court of appeals vacate the board order it conclude that the prohibition on act service by nominee contain in subsection b apply to all act officer regardless of whether they serve pursuant to subsection a a or a as a result solomon become ineligible to perform the duty of general counsel in a act capacity once the president nominate he to fill that post hold subsection b of the fvra prevent a person who have be nominate to fill a vacant pas office from perform the duty of that office in a act capacity the prohibition apply to anyone perform act service under the fvra it be not limit to first assistant perform act service under subsection a a the text of the fvra require this conclusion subsection b apply to any person and prohibit service as a act officer for a office under this section person have a expansive meaning that can encompass anyone who perform act duty under the fvra see pfizer government of india and under this section clarify that subsection b apply to all of the fvra contain to specific subsection and paragraph but subsection b refer to which contain all of the way a person may become a act officer the rest of the fvra also use the pairing of person and section to encompass anyone serve as a act officer under the fvra and congress could readily have use more specific language if it intend subsection b to apply only to first assistant act under a the dependent clause at the beginning of subsection b n otwithstand subsection a confirm the breadth of the prohibition on act service by nominee in statute notwithstanding clause show that one provision prevail over another in the event of a conflict here that mean that subsection b apply even when it conflict with the default rule in a that first assistant shall perform act duty the board argue that because the phrase notwithstanding subsection a do not mention a or a congress do not intend the prohibition in subsection b to apply to people serve as act officer under those provision the board rely on the interpretive canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius express one item of a associate group or series exclude another left unmentioned chevron echazabal internal quotation mark omit this interpretive canon apply however only when circumstance support a sensible inference that the term leave out must have be mean to be exclude at a notwithstanding clause do not naturally give rise to such a inference it just show which of two or more provision prevail in the event of a conflict single out one conflict generally do not suggest that other unaddressed conflict should be resolve in the opposite manner here the conflict between a and b be unique the former use mandatory language the first assistant shall perform act duty while the latter identify who may not serve as a act officer the notwithstanding clause clarify that the mandatory language in subsection a do not prevail over subsection b in the event of a conflict subsection a and a lack that mandatory language so the natural inference be that congress leave these provision out of the notwithstanding clause because they differ from subsection a not to implicitly exempt they from the prohibition in subsection b moreover subsection b specify that b shall not apply to certain people who be serve as the first assistant if b apply only to first assistant state that limitation would be superfluous b because the text be clear the board argument about legislative history purpose and practice need not be consider in any event its argument be not compelling the original draft of the fvra contain a prohibition on nominee serve as act officer but explicitly limit that prohibition to first assistant the board argue that when congress revise this original draft it make change to give the president more flexibility to appoint act officer and do not intend to broaden the prohibition on nominee perform act service the glitch in this argument be that congress do change the prohibition on nominee perform act service revise it to clearly apply to all act officer the fact that certain senators state that they want to give the president more flexibility to appoint act official do not mean that they get exactly what they want nor do a statement by one of the sponsor of the fvra who say that subsection b apply only to first assistant overcome the clear text particularly give that the very next senator to speak offer a contradictory account of the provision the board also argue that since the fvra be enact congress have not object when president have nominate individual who be serve as act officer under subsection a or a and that the office of legal counsel and government accountability office have issue guidance construe subsection b to apply only to first assistant rely on nlrb noel canning the board contend that this historical practice be entitle to significant weight h istorical practice be too grand a title for the board evidence the fvra be not enact until and the evidence the board cite be not significant enough to warrant the conclusion that congress failure to speak up imply that it have acquiesce in the view that subsection b apply only to first assistant by contrast the court decision in noel canning deal with the president constitutional authority under the recess appointment clause a issue that have attract intense attention from president attorneys general and the senate date back to the beginning of the republic apply the fvra to this case be straightforward subsection b prohibit solomon from continue he service as act general counsel once the president nominate he to fill the position permanently the president could have appoint another person to serve as act officer in solomon place but do not do so affirm roberts deliver the opinion of the court in which kennedy

united state court of appeal for the district of columbia circuit march chief justice roberts deliver the opinion of the court article ii of the constitution require that the president obtain the advice and consent of the senate before appoint officer of the united states cl give this provision the responsibility of a office require presidential appointment and senate confirmation know as a pas office may go unperformed if a vacancy arise and the president and senate can not promptly agree on a replacement congress have long account for this reality by authorize the president to direct certain official to temporarily carry out the duty of a vacant pas office in a act capacity without senate confirmation the federal vacancy reform act of fvra et be the latest version of that authorization section a of the fvra authorize three class of government official to become act officer the general rule be that the first assistant to a vacant office shall become the act officer the president may override that default rule by direct either a person serve in a different pas office or a senior employee within the relevant agency to become the act officer instead the fvra however prohibit certain person from serve as act officer if the president have nominate they to fill the vacant office permanently the question present be whether that limitation apply only to first assistant who have automatically assume act duty or whether it also apply to pas officer and senior employee serve as act officer at the president behest we hold that it apply to all three category of act officer i a the senate advice and consent power be a critical structural safeguard of the constitutional scheme edmond united states the framers envision it as a excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the president and a guard against the appointment of unfit character from family connection from personal attachment or from a view to popularity the federalist rossiter ed hamilton the constitutional process of presidential appointment and senate confirmation however can take time the president may not promptly settle on a nominee to fill a office the senate may be unable or unwilling to speedily confirm the nominee once submit yet neither may desire to see the duty of the vacant office go unperformed in the interim since president washington first term congress have give the president limited authority to appoint act official to temporarily perform the function of a vacant pas office without first obtain senate approval the earliest statute authorize the appointment of any person or person to fill specific vacancy in the departments of state treasury and war act of may ch stat congress at first allow act officer to serve until the permanent officeholder could resume he duty or a successor be appoint but soon impose a limit on act service act of ch stat congress revisit the issue in the ultimately pass the vacancy act of the vacancy act expand the number of pas office that the president could fill with act officer act of july ch stat see also act of ch stat with that expansion come new constraint the authority to appoint any person or person as a act officer give way to a default rule that the first or sole assistant shall perform that function with a exception allow the president to instead fill the post with a person already serve in a pas office stat and rather than six month of act service the vacancy act generally authorize only ten day ibid that narrow window of act service be later lengthen to day act of ch stat during the and interbranch conflict arise over the vacancy act the department of justice take the position that in many instance the head of a executive agency have independent authority apart from the vacancy act to temporarily fill vacant office the comptroller general disagree argue that the act be the exclusive authority for temporarily fill vacancy in executive agency see rosenberg congressional research service report for congress the new vacancy act congress act to protect the senate confirmation prerogative rosenberg congress then amend the vacancy act to clarify that it apply to such agency while at the same time lengthen the term of permissible act service to day with a toll period while a nomination be pend at see presidential transition effectiveness act stat but tension do not ease by approximately percent of pas office in executive agency be occupy by temporary designee most of whom have serve beyond the limitation period without presidential submission of nomination rosenberg these act officer fill position sometimes in obvious contravention of the senate wish one for instance be bring in from outside government to serve as acting assistant attorney general for the civil rights division of the justice department immediately after the senate refuse to confirm he for that very office see rosenberg congressional research service validity of designation of bill lann lee as acting assistant attorney general for civil rights perceive a threat to the senate advice and consent power see rosenberg congress act again in it replace the vacancy act with the fvra section a of the fvra permit three category of government official to perform act service in a vacant pas office subsection a prescribe a general rule if a person serve in a pas office die resign or be otherwise unable to perform he duty the first assistant to that office shall perform the office function and duty temporarily in a act capacity the next two paragraph of a identify alternative subsection a provide that notwithstanding paragraph the president may direct a person who already serve in a pas office to perform the function and duty of the vacant office temporarily in a act capacity subsection a add that notwithstanding paragraph the president may direct a person to perform act duty if the person serve in a senior position in the relevant agency for at least day in the period precede the vacancy section also make certain individual ineligible for act service subsection b state notwithstanding subsection a a person may not serve as a act officer for a office under this section if the president nominate he for the vacant pas office and during the period precede the vacancy the individual do not serve in the position of first assistant to that office or serve in that position for less than day subsection b create a exception to this prohibition provide that p aragraph shall not apply to any person serve in a first assistant position that itself require the senate advice and consent other section of the fvra establish time limit on act service and penalty for noncompliance in most case the statute permit act service for day begin on the date the vacancy occur toll that time limit while a nomination be pend and start a new clock if the nomination be reject withdraw or return a b upon a second nomination the time limit toll once more and a act officer can serve a additional day if the second nomination prove unsuccessful b the fvra ensure compliance by provide that in general any function or duty of a vacant office perform by a person not properly serve under the statute shall have no force or effect d b the national labor relations board nlrb or board be charge with administer the national labor relations act by statute its general counsel must be appoint by the president with the advice and consent of the senate d in june the nlrb general counsel who have be serve with senate confirmation resign the president direct lafe solomon to serve temporarily as the nlrb act general counsel cite the fvra as the basis for the appointment see memorandum from president barack obama to solomon june solomon satisfy the requirement for act service under subsection a of the fvra because he have spend the previous ten year in the senior position of director of the nlrb office of representation appeals the president have bigger plan for solomon than act service on january he nominate solomon to serve as the nlrb general counsel on a permanent basis the senate have other idea that body do not act upon the nomination during the congress so it be return to the president when the legislative session expire cong rec the president resubmit solomon name for consideration in the spring of at may but to no avail the president ultimately withdraw solomon nomination and put forward a new candidate whom the senate confirm on october at throughout this entire period solomon serve as the nlrb act general counsel solomon responsibility include exercise final authority to issue complaint allege unfair labor practice d b in january a nlrb regional director exercise authority on solomon behalf issue a complaint allege that respondent sw general a company that provide ambulance service have improperly fail to pay certain bonus to employee a administrative law judge conclude that sw general have commit unfair labor practice and the nlrb agree sw general file a petition for review in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit it argue that the unfair labor practice complaint be invalid because under subsection b of the fvra solomon could not legally perform the duty of general counsel after have be nominate to fill that position the nlrb defend solomon action it contend that subsection b apply only to first assistant who automatically assume act duty under subsection a not to act officer who like solomon serve under a or a the court of appeals grant sw general petition for review and vacate the board order it reason that the text of subsection b squarely support the conclusion that the provision restriction on nominee serve as act officer apply to all act officer no matter whether they serve pursuant to subsection a a or a cadc as a result solomon become ineligible to serve as acting general counsel once the president nominate he to be general counsel at we grant certiorari and now affirm ii subsection b of the fvra prevent a person who have be nominate for a vacant pas office from perform the duty of that office in a act capacity in full it state notwithstanding subsection a a person may not serve as a act officer for a office under this section if a during the period precede the date of the death resignation or beginning of inability to serve such person i do not serve in the position of first assistant to the office of such officer or ii serve in the position of first assistant to the office of such officer for less than day and b the president submit a nomination of such person to the senate for appointment to such office subsection b add that p aragraph shall not apply to a person serve in a first assistant position that itself require the advice and consent of the senate we conclude that the prohibition in subsection b apply to anyone perform act service under the fvra it be not as the board contend limit to first assistant perform act service under subsection a the text of the prohibition extend to any person who serve as a act officer under this section not just to first assistant serve under subsection a the phrase n otwithstand subsection a do not limit the reach of b but instead clarify that the prohibition apply even when it conflict with the default rule that first assistant shall perform act duty a we analysis of subsection b begin with its text subsection b apply to any person and prohibit service as a act officer for a office under this section the key word be person and section they clearly indicate that b apply to all act officer under regardless of the means of appointment start with person the word have a naturally expansive meaning that can encompass anyone who perform act duty under the fvra see pfizer government of india important as they may be first assistant be not the only person s of the bunch now add under this section the language clarify that subsection b apply to all person serve under congress often draft statute with hierarchical scheme section subsection paragraph and on down the line see koons buick pontiac gmc nigh filson the legislative drafter desk reference congress use that structure in the fvra and rely on it to make precise when congress want to refer only to a particular subsection or paragraph it say so see a subsection b b paragraph but in b congress refer to the entire section which subsume all of the way a person may become a act officer the rest of the fvra use the pairing of person and section the same way section for example specify how long the person serve as a act officer as describe under section may serve in the office emphasis add and d describe the consequence of noncompliance with the fvra by refer to the action take by any person who be not act under section or emphasis add no one dispute that both provision apply to anyone serve as a act officer under the fvra not just first assistant serve under subsection a have congress intend subsection b to apply only to first assistant act under a it could easily have choose clearer language replace person with first assistant would have do the trick so too would replace under this section with under subsection a the fact that congress do not adopt either readily available and apparent alternative strongly support the conclusion that subsection b apply to any act officer appoint under any provision within knight commissioner the dependent clause at the beginning of subsection b n otwithstand subsection a confirm that the prohibition on act service apply even when it conflict with the default rule that the first assistant shall perform act duty the ordinary meaning of notwithstanding be in spite of or without prevention or obstruction from or by webster third new international dictionary black law dictionary ed despite in spite of in statute the word show which provision prevail in the event of a clash scalia garner reading law the interpretation of legal text subsection a set the rule that first assistant shall perform the vacant office function and duty in a act capacity but the notwithstanding clause in subsection b mean that even if a first assistant be serve as a act officer under this statutory mandate he must cease that service if the president nominate he to fill the vacant pas office that subsection b also apply to act officer serve at the president behest be already clear from the broad text of the independent clause they be all person s serve under this section the board take a different view of the phrase n otwithstand subsection a it begin by note that a use three different subsection to create three separate path for become a act official reply brief the prohibition in subsection b the board continue apply n otwithstand only one of these subsection subsection a ibid in the board view single out subsection a carry a negative implication that congress do not intend subsection b to override the alternative mechanism for act service in subsection a and a at we disagree the board rely on the interpretive canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius express one item of a associate group or series exclude another left unmentioned chevron echazabal quote united states vonn if a sign at the entrance to a zoo say come see the elephant lion hippo and giraffe and a temporary sign be add say the giraffe be sick you would reasonably assume that the other be in good health the force of any negative implication however depend on context marx general revenue slip at the expressio unius canon apply only when circumstance support a sensible inference that the term leave out must have be mean to be exclude echazabal at a notwithstanding clause do not naturally give rise to such a inference it just show which of two or more provision prevail in the event of a conflict such a clause confirm rather than constrain breadth single out one potential conflict might suggest that congress think the conflict be particularly difficult to resolve or be quite likely to arise but do so generally do not imply anything about other unaddressed conflict much less that they should be resolve in the opposite manner suppose a radio station announce we play you favorite hit from the and notwithstanding the fact that we play hit from the we do not play music by british band you would not tune in expect to hear the british band the clash any more than the beatle the station after all have announce that we do not play music by british band the notwithstanding clause just establish that this apply even to music from the when british band be prominently feature on the chart no one however would think the station single out the to convey implicitly that its categorical statement we do not play music by british band actually do not apply to the and draw a negative inference from the notwithstanding clause in subsection b be similarly inapt without that clause subsection b plainly would apply to all person serve as act officer under a add notwithstanding subsection a make sense because a conflict with b in a unique manner the former be mandatory and the first assistant shall perform act duty the latter by contrast speak to who may not be a act officer so if a vacancy arise and the president nominate the first assistant to fill the position a say the first assistant shall perform the duty of that office in a act capacity while the nomination be pend and b say he may not the notwithstanding clause clarify that the language of a do not prevail if that conflict occur compare the mandatory language of subsection a to a and a people appoint under those provision be just as much act officer as first assistant who assume the role but there be no freestanding directive that they perform act duty subsection a and a just say that the president may direct they to do so the natural inference then be that congress leave these provision out of the notwithstanding clause because they be different from subsection a not to exempt from the broad prohibition in subsection b those officer serve under a and a indeed notwithstanding be use the same way in other part of subsection a and a be each precede by the phrase notwithstanding paragraph the phrase recognize that subsection a be unique and resolve the potential conflict between the mandatory shall perform in that provision and the permissive may direct in a and a but it imply nothing about other potential conflict that may arise in the statutory scheme in subsection b it work the same way the notwithstanding clause simply show that b override a and nothing more step back from the board focus on notwithstanding and another problem appear its interpretation of subsection b make a mess of b subsection b specify that b shall not apply to any person if a that person be serve as the first assistant b the first assistant position be itself a pas office and c the senate have approve the appointment of such person to that office the board interpretation make the first requirement superfluous a result we typically try to avoid williams taylor it be a cardinal principle of statutory construction that we must give effect if possible to every clause and word of a statute internal quotation mark omit if subsection b apply only to first assistant there would be no need to state the requirement in b a that such person be serve as the first assistant the board propose that congress do so for clarity but the same could be say of most superfluous language the board and the dissent counter that apply the prohibition in subsection b to anyone perform act service under a have its own problem do so would also require apply it to c which would nullify that provision reply brief the dissent deem this no way to read a statute post at we agree and it be not the way we read it under we reading subsection b have no effect on c subsection b address nomination generally prohibit any person who have be nominate to fill any vacant office from perform that office duty in a act capacity subsection c speak to a specific nomination scenario when a person be nominate by the president for reappointment for a additional term to the same office without a break in service in this particular situation the fvra authorize the nominee to continue to serve in that office c i t be a commonplace of statutory construction that the specific govern the general radlax gateway hotel llc amalgamated bank the general prohibition on act service by nominee yield to the more specific authorization allow officer up for reappointment to remain at they post apply subsection b to a hardly compel a different result the text of subsection b be clear subject to one narrow exception it prohibit anyone who have be nominate to fill a vacant pas office from perform the duty of that office in a act capacity regardless of whether the act officer be appoint under subsection a a or a it be not limit to first assistant who automatically assume act duty under a b the board contend that legislative history purpose and practice uniformly show that subsection b apply only to first assistant the text be clear so we need not consider this evidence see state farm fire casualty united states ex rel rigsby slip at in any event the board evidence be not compelling the board argue that subsection b be design to serve a specific purpose prevent the president from have he nominee serve as a act officer by make he first assistant after or right before a vacancy arise brief for petitioner the original draft of the fvra authorize first assistant and pas officer to perform act service subsection b of that draft provide that if a first assistant be nominate to fill the vacant office he could not perform that office duty in a act capacity unless he have be the first assistant for at least day before the vacancy several senator think the fvra too restrictive they ask to add senior agency official to the list of potential act officer and to shorten the requirement in subsection b they request the board say be grant the final version of the fvra include subsection a for senior employee and shorten the requirement to day there be no intent to extend the prohibition in subsection b beyond first assistant at the glitch in this argument be of course the text of subsection b congress do amend the statute to allow senior employee to become act officer under subsection a the only substantive change that be request in b be to reduce the requirement congress could have do that with a few tweak to the original version of subsection b instead congress go further it also remove language that expressly limit subsection b to first assistant and it add a provision subsection b that make sense only if b apply to all act officer in short congress take a provision that explicitly apply only to first assistant and turn it into one that apply to all act officer the board protest that congress would not have expand the prohibition on nominee serve as act officer after senators ask to give the president more flexibility see brief for petitioner that certain senator make specific demand however do not mean that they get exactly what they want pass a law often require compromise where even the most firm public demand bend to compete interest see ragsdale wolverine world wide what congress ultimately agree on be the text that it enact not the preference express by certain legislator see oncale sundowner offshore services i t be ultimately the provision of we law rather than the principal concern of we legislator by which we be govern compromise be precisely what happen here a period of intense negotiation take place after senators demand change to the original draft of the fvra and the final bill be a compromise measure rosenberg the legislation as pass do expand the pool of individual the president could appoint as act officer by add senior employee in subsection a but it also expand the scope of the limitation on act service in b by drop the language making b applicable only to first assistant the board contend that this compromise must not have happen because senator thompson one of the sponsor of the fvra say that subsection b apply only when the act officer be the first assistant and not when the act officer be designate by the president pursuant to a or a cong rec but senator byrd the very next speaker offer a contradictory account a nominee may not serve as a act officer if he be not the first assistant or have be the first assistant for less than day and have not be confirm for the position at this be a good example of why floor statement by individual legislator rank among the least illuminating form of legislative history see milner department of navy those of we who make use of legislative history believe that clear evidence of congressional intent may illuminate ambiguous text we will not take the opposite tack of allow ambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory language finally the board support its interpretation with practice it note that the office of legal counsel and the government accountability office have issue guidance construe subsection b to apply only to first assistant and three president have without congressional objection submit the nomination of individual who be serve as act officer under subsection a and a the board contend that this historical practice be entitle to significant weight because the fvra concern s the allocation of power between two elect branch of government brief for petitioner quote nlrb noel canning slip at internal quotation mark omit h istorical practice be too grand a title for the board evidence the fvra be not enact until and the nomination that the board cite make up less than two percent of the thousand of nomination to position in executive agency that the senate have consider in the year since its passage even the guidance document the board cite pay the matter little attention both make conclusory statement about subsection b with no analysis in this context congress failure to speak up do not fairly imply that it have acquiesce in the board interpretation see zuber allen alexander sandoval the senate may not have notice that certain nominee be serve as act officer in violation of the fvra or it may have choose not to reject a qualified candidate just to make a point about compliance with the statute either be at least as plausible as the theory that the legislature inaction reflect consider acceptance of the executive practice we decision in noel canning the chief opinion on which the board rely be a sharp contrast that case deal with the president constitutional authority under the recess appointment clause a issue that have attract intense attention and written analysis from president attorneys general and the senate at slip at the voluminous historical record date back to the beginning of the republic and include thousand of recess appointment at slip at that the chronicle of the recess appointment clause weigh heavily in noel canning offer no support to the board here iii apply the fvra to this case be straightforward solomon be appoint as act general counsel under subsection a once the president submit he nomination to fill that position in a permanent capacity subsection b prohibit he from continue he act service this do not mean that the duty of general counsel to the nlrb need to go unperformed the president could have appoint another person to serve as the act officer in solomon place and he have a wide array of individual to choose from any one of the approximately senior nlrb employee or the hundred of individual in pas position throughout the government the president however do not do so and solomon continued service violate the fvra accordingly the judgment of the court of appeals be affirm it be so order appendix section of the fvra provide a if a

ing that person to serve as a officer the fvra authorize the president to appoint both inferior and principal officer without first obtain the advice and consent of the senate appoint inferior officer in this manner raise no constitutional problem that be because the appointments clause authorize congress to enact law s like the fvra vest ing the appointment of such inferior officer in the president alone appoint principal officer under the fvra however raise grave constitutional concern because the appointments clause forbid the president to appoint principal officer without the advice and consent of the senate ii because we interpret the fvra to forbid solomon appointment in this case we need not confront these concern but the dissent contrary interpretation necessarily raise the question whether that appointment comply with the requirement of the appointments clause that inquiry turn on two consideration whether the general counsel of the nlrb be a officer of the united states within the meaning of the appointments clause and if so whether he be a principal officer who can be appoint only by and with the advice and consent of the senate in my view the general counsel plainly be a officer of the united states i also think he be likely a principal officer a as a initial matter the nlrb general counsel be a officer of the united states whose appointment be govern by

general counsel be effectively the nation prosecutor and be therefore a officer of the united states see edmond at treat the general counsel of the department of transportation as a officer b although a closer question the general counsel also be likely a principal officer in edmond we explain that a inferior officer be one whose work be direct and supervise at some level by other who be appoint by presidential nomination with the advice and consent of the senate at that view be consistent with the original meaning of the term and with the practice of the early congress see at morrison olson scalia dissent see also sheridan supra inferiour johnson supra inferiour def webster supra inferior by contrast a principal officer be one who have no superior other than the president the general

enterprise fund at holding that executive official be inferior officer in large part because they be subject to a superior removal because it appear that the general counsel answer to no officer inferior to the president he be likely a principal officer accordingly the president likely could not lawfully have appoint solomon to serve in that role without first obtain the advice and consent of the senate iii i recognize that the burden on governmental process that the appointments clause impose may often seem clumsy inefficient even unworkable ins chadha grant the president unilateral power to fill vacancy in high office might contribute to more efficient government but the appointments clause be not a empty formality although the framers recognize the potential value of leave the selection of officer to one man of discernment rather than to a fractious multimember body see the federalist cooke they also recognize the serious risk for abuse and corruption pose by permit one

senate to confirm principal officer on the view that the necessity of its in the business of appointment will be a considerable and salutary restraint upon the conduct of the president the federalist at story supra at we can not cast aside the separation of power and the appointments clause important check on executive power for the sake of administrative convenience or efficiency see bowsher

general dba southwest ambulance on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the district of columbia circuit march justice sotomayor with whom justice ginsburg join dissent many office in the executive branch may be fill only by a person who have be nominate to the position by the president and confirm by the senate the federal vacancy reform act of fvra cede the senate confirmation authority partially and on a temporary basis to allow executive agency to continue to function when one of those office become vacant it authorize certain category of official to perform the duty of vacant office on a act basis one of its provision pull back that authorization when a official have be nominate to fill the vacant office on a permanent basis the scope of that provision be at issue here i agree with the court that the provision apply to first assistant to a vacant office who serve as act official automatically by operation of the fvra i with the court conclusion that the provision also apply to other official who may serve as act official if the president direct they to serve in that capacity the court give the provision a broader reach than the text can bear with no support from the history of or practice under the fvra i respectfully dissent i as the court explain the fvra govern vacancy in office hold by person whose appointment to office be require to be make by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate a these be know as pas office when a official in a pas office die resign or be otherwise unable to perform the function and duty of the office the fvra step in see also c a expiration of a term of office make a official unable to perform the function and duty of the office section of the fvra authorize four category of official to perform the duty of a vacant office subsection a contain a default rule the first assistant to the office automatically assume the vacant office and perform the function and duty of the office temporarily in a act capacity a subsection a a and c authorize the president to override that default rule the president may direct a person already confirm by the senate to a pas office to serve as the act officer see a the president may direct certain senior official in the same agency to serve as the act officer see a or the president may direct a person whose term in the office have expire and who have be nominate to a subsequent term in that same office to serve as the act officer until the senate act on the nomination see c subsection b take away this authorization in a specific situation it provide that n otwithstand subsection a the first assistant default rule a person may not serve as a act official while nominate to fill the office if the person be not the first assistant to the office for at least of the day precede the vacancy b the prohibition in subsection b do not apply to a person serve as the first assistant to the vacant office see b ii in my view the text purpose and history of the fvra make clear that the prohibition in subsection b apply only to a first assistant who perform the duty of a vacant office under subsection a a as the court observe subsection b contain some potentially broad language the provision specify when a person may not serve as a act officer for a office under this section that be the word person and this section take in isolation could signal that the prohibition apply to subsection a a a and c and thus cover all act official but context matter and here the context cabin those word and give subsection b a more limited reach the text of subsection b contain a clear signal that its prohibition apply only to first assistant who automatically assume a vacant office under subsection a it begin with the clause n otwithstand subsection a a notwithstanding clause identify a potential conflict between two or more provision and specify which provision will prevail under the familiar expressio unius est exclusio alterius interpretive canon the choice to single out subsection a and only subsection a in this notwithstanding clause strongly suggest that the prohibition reach and conflict with subsection a and only subsection a the rest of confirm this conclusion the prohibition in subsection b establish who may not perform the duty of a vacant office in do so it introduce a potential conflict with subsection a a a and c which identify four category of person who may perform the duty of a vacant office by state that its prohibition apply n otwithstand subsection a subsection b expressly state that its prohibition take precedence over the default rule set out in subsection a the omission of any reference to subsection a a and c in spite of the parallel potential for conflict with those subsection suggest that the omission be a deliberate choice not inadvertence bruesewitz wyeth llc quote barnhart peabody coal that choice mean that subsection b trump subsection a but not subsection a a and c nothing about a notwithstanding clause render it impervious to this established rule of statutory interpretation the court say that the rule have less force in the context of a notwithstanding clause because such a clause confirm rather than constrain the breadth of the provision to which it be attach ante at but the breadth of the attach provision be precisely the question here and the clause specific reference to subsection a and only subsection a strongly support read the attach prohibition to limit only subsection a see preseault icc a reference to this act in a notwithstanding clause limit the scope of the attach provision emphasis delete the court claim that the reference to subsection a may serve a different purpose in its view the reference might instead demonstrate a congressional concern that a conflict between subsection b and subsection a would be quite likely to arise or particularly difficult to resolve ante at a closer examination do not bear out this hypothesis the text itself refute the theory that subsection b be more likely to conflict with subsection a than the other subsection the prohibition in subsection b do not apply t
