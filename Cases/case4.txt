the agricultural marketing agreement act of authorize the secretary of agriculture to promulgate marketing order to help maintain stable market for particular agricultural product the marketing order for raisin establish a raisin administrative committee that impose a reserve requirement a requirement that grower set aside a certain percentage of they crop for the account of the government free of charge the government make use of those raisin by sell they in noncompetitive market donate they or dispose of they by any means consistent with the purpose of the program if any profit be leave over after subtract the government expense from administer the program the net proceeds be distribute back to the raisin grower in raisin grower be require to set aside percent of they raisin crop under the reserve requirement in percent marvin horne laura horne and they family be raisin grower who refuse to set aside any raisin for the government on the ground that the reserve requirement be a unconstitutional taking of they property for public use without just compensation the government fine the hornes the fair market value of the raisin as well as additional civil penalty for they failure to obey the raisin marketing order the hornes seek relief in federal court argue that the reserve requirement be a unconstitutional taking of they property under the fifth amendment on remand from this court over the issue of jurisdiction horne department of agriculture the ninth circuit hold that the reserve requirement be not a fifth amendment taking the court determine that the requirement be not a per se take because personal property be afford less protection under the takings clause than real property and because the hornes who retain a interest in any net proceeds be not completely divest of they property the ninth circuit hold that as in case allow the government to set condition on land use and development the government impose a condition the reserve requirement in exchange for a government benefit a orderly raisin market it hold that the hornes could avoid relinquish large percentage of they crop by plant different crop hold the fifth amendment require that the government pay just compensation when it take personal property just as when it take real property any net proceeds the raisin grower receive from the sale of the reserve raisin go to the amount of compensation they have receive for that take it do not mean the raisin have not be appropriate for government use nor can the government make raisin grower relinquish they property without just compensation as a condition of sell they raisin in interstate commerce a the fifth amendment apply to personal property as well as real property the government have a categorical duty to pay just compensation when it take you car just as when it take you home this principle date back as far as magna carta be codify in the takings clause in part because of property appropriation by both side during the revolutionary war this court have note that a owner of personal property may expect that new regulation of the use of property could render he property economically worthless lucas south carolina coastal council but there be still a longstanding distinction between regulation concern the use of property and government acquisition of property preservation council tahoe regional planning agency when it come to physical appropriation people do not expect they property real or personal to be actually occupy or take away the reserve requirement impose by the raisin committee be a clear physical taking actual raisin be transfer from the grower to the government title to the raisin pass to the raisin committee the committee dispose of those raisin as it wish to promote the purpose of the raisin marketing order the government formal demand that the hornes turn over a percentage of they raisin crop without charge for the government control and use be of such a unique character that it be a take without regard to other factor that a court might ordinarily examine loretto teleprompter manhattan catv b the fact that the grower be entitle to the net proceeds of the raisin sale do not mean that there have be no take at all when there have be a physical appropriation we do not ask whether it deprive the owner of all economically valuable use of the item take preservation council at the fact that the grower retain a contingent interest of indeterminate value do not mean there have be no taking particularly when that interest depend on the discretion of the taker and may be worthless as it be for one of the two year at issue here andrus allard distinguish once there be a take as in the case of a physical appropriation any payment from the government in connection with that action go at most to the question of just compensation c the take in this case also can not be characterize as part of a voluntary exchange for a valuable government benefit in one of the year at issue the government insist that the hornes part with percent of they crop for the privilege of sell the rest but the ability to sell produce in interstate commerce although certainly subject to reasonable government regulation be not a benefit that the government may withhold unless grower waive constitutional protection ruckelshaus monsanto distinguish leonard leonard earle distinguish d the hornes be not require to first pay the fine and then seek compensation under the tucker act see horne at because they have the full economic interest in the raisin the government allege should have be set aside for its account they own the raisin they grow as well as the raisin they handle have pay the grower for all of they raisin not just they raisin they may raise a defense to the fine levy against they there be no need for the ninth circuit to calculate the just compensation due on remand the clear and administrable rule be that just compensation normally be to be measure by the market value of the property at the time of the taking united states acre of land here the government already calculate that amount when it fine the hornes the fair market value of the raisin reverse roberts deliver the opinion of the court in which scalia kennedy thomas and alito join and in which ginsburg breyer and kagan join as to parts i and ii thomas file a

united state court of appeal for the ninth circuit june chief justice roberts deliver the opinion of the court under the united states department of agriculture california raisin marketing order a percentage of a grower crop must be physically set aside in certain year for the account of the government free of charge the government then sell allocate or otherwise dispose of the raisin in way it determine be best suit to maintain a orderly market the question be whether the takings clause of the fifth amendment bar the government from impose such a demand on the grower without just compensation i the agricultural marketing agreement act of authorize the secretary of agriculture to promulgate marketing order to help maintain stable market for particular agricultural product the marketing order for raisin require grower in certain year to give a percentage of they crop to the government free of charge the require allocation be determine by the raisin administrative committee a government entity compose largely of grower and other in the raisin business appoint by the secretary of agriculture in this committee order raisin grower to turn over percent of they crop in percent grower generally ship they raisin to a raisin handler who physically separate the raisin due the government call reserve raisin pay the grower only for the remainder raisin and pack and sell the raisin the raisin committee acquire title to the reserve raisin that have be set aside and decide how to dispose of they in its discretion it sell they in noncompetitive market for example to exporter federal agency or foreign government donate they to charitable cause release they to grower who agree to reduce they raisin production or dispose of they by any other means consistent with the purpose of the raisin program cfr b proceeds from committee sale be principally use to subsidize handler who sell raisin for export not include the hornes who be not raisin exporter raisin grower retain a interest in any net proceeds from sale the raisin committee make after deduction for the export subsidy and the committee administrative expense in the year at issue in this case those proceeds be less than the cost of produce the crop one year and nothing at all the next the hornes marvin horne laura horne and they family be both raisin grower and handler they handle not only they own raisin but also those produce by other grower pay those grower in full for all of they raisin not just the portion in the hornes refuse to set aside any raisin for the government believe they be not legally bind to do so the government send truck to the hornes facility at eight one morning to pick up the raisin but the hornes refuse entry app post at sotomayor dissent the government then assess against the hornes a fine equal to the market value of the miss raisin some as well as a additional civil penalty of just over for disobey the order to turn they over when the government seek to collect the fine the hornes turn to the court argue that the reserve requirement be a unconstitutional taking of they property under the fifth amendment they case eventually make it to this court when the government argue that the lower court have no jurisdiction to consider the hornes constitutional defense to the fine horne department of agriculture horne i we reject the government argument and send the case back to the court of appeals so it could address the hornes contention on the merit at slip at on remand the ninth circuit agree with the hornes that the validity of the fine rise or fall with the constitutionality of the reserve requirement the court then consider whether that requirement be a physical appropriation of property give rise to a per se take or a restriction on a raisin grower use of he property properly analyze under the more flexible and forgiving standard for a regulatory taking the court reject the hornes argument that the reserve requirement be a per se take reasoning that the takings clause afford less protection to personal than to real property and conclude that the hornes be not completely divest of they property rights because grower retain a interest in the proceeds from any sale of reserve raisin by the raisin committee at the court instead view the reserve requirement as a use restriction similar to a government condition on the grant of a land use permit see dolan city of tigard nollan california coastal comm n as in such permit case the court of appeals explain the government here impose a condition the reserve requirement in exchange for a government benefit a orderly raisin market and just as a landowner be free to avoid the government condition by forgo a permit so too the hornes could avoid the reserve requirement by plant different crop at under that analysis the court find that the reserve requirement be a proportional response to the government interest in ensure a orderly raisin market and not a take under the fifth amendment we grant certiorari ii the petition for certiorari pose three question which we answer in turn a the first question present ask whether the government categorical duty under the fifth amendment to pay just compensation when it physically take possession of a interest in property arkansas game fish comm united states apply only to real property and not to personal property the answer be no there be no dispute that the classic take be one in which the government directly appropriate private property for its own use preservation council tahoe regional planning agency bracket and internal quotation mark omit nor be there any dispute that in the case of real property such a appropriation be a per se take that require just compensation see loretto teleprompter manhattan catv nothing in the text or history of the takings clause or we precedent suggest that the rule be any different when it come to appropriation of personal property the government have a categorical duty to pay just compensation when it take you car just as when it take you home the takings clause provide n or shall private property be take for public use without just compensation amdt it protect private property without any distinction between different type the principle reflect in the clause go back at least year to magna carta which specifically protect agricultural crop from uncompensated takings clause of that charter forbid any constable or other bailiff from take corn or other provision from any one without tender money therefor unless he can have postponement thereof by permission of the seller cl in mckechnie magna carta a commentary on the great charter of king john ed the colonist bring the principle of magna carta with they to the new world include that charter protection against uncompensated takings of personal property in for example massachusetts adopt its body of liberties prohibit man cattel or goods of what kinde soever from be press or take for any publique use or service unlesse it be by warrant ground upon some act of the generall court nor without such reasonable price and hire as the ordinarie rate of the countrie do afford massachusetts body of liberties in perry source of we liberties virginia allow the seizure of surplus live stock or beef pork or bacon for the military but only upon pay or tender to the owner the price so estimate by the appraiser act ch xii and south carolina authorize the seizure of necessaries for public use but provide that say article so seize shall be pay for agreeable to the price such and the like article sell for on the ninth day of october last act give that background it be not surprising that early americans bridle at appropriation of they personal property during the revolutionary war at the hand of both side john jay for example complain to the new york legislature about military impressment by the continental army of horse teems and carriages and voice he fear that such action by the little officer of the quartermasters department might extend to blanket shoe and many other article a hint to the legislature of the state of new york in john jay the make of a revolutionary morris ed emphasis delete the legislature take the hint pass a law that among other thing provide for compensation for the impressment of horse and carriage laws ch accord to the author of the first treatise on the constitution george tucker the takings clause be probably adopt in response to the arbitrary and oppressive mode of obtain supplies for the army and other public use by impressment as be too frequently practise during the revolutionary war without any compensation whatever blackstone commentary editor app nothing in this history suggest that personal property be any less protect against physical appropriation than real property as this court sum up in james campbell a case concern the alleged appropriation of a patent by the government a patent confer upon the patentee a exclusive property in the patented invention which can not be appropriate or use by the government itself without just compensation any more than it can appropriate or use without compensation land which have be patent to a private purchaser prior to this court decision in pennsylvania coal mahon the takings clause be understand to provide protection only against a direct appropriation of property personal or real pennsylvania coal expand the protection of the takings clause hold that compensation be also require for a regulatory take a restriction on the use of property that go too far at and in penn central transp new york city the court clarify that the test for how far be too far require a ad hoc factual inquiry that inquiry require consider factor such as the economic impact of the regulation its interference with reasonable expectation and the character of the government action four year after penn central however the court reaffirm the rule that a physical appropriation of property give rise to a per se take without regard to other factor in loretto the court hold that require a owner of a apartment building to allow installation of a cable box on she rooftop be a physical taking of real property for which compensation be require that be true without regard to the claim public benefit or the economic impact on the owner the court explain that such protection be justified not only by history but also because s uch a appropriation be perhaps the most serious form of invasion of a owner property interest deprive the owner of the the rights to possess use and dispose of the property at internal quotation mark omit that reasoning both with respect to history and logic be equally applicable to a physical appropriation of personal property the ninth circuit base its distinction between real and personal property on this court discussion in lucas south carolina coastal council a case involve extensive limitation on the use of shorefront property at lucas recognize that while a owner of personal property ought to be aware of the possibility that new regulation might even render he property economically worthless such a imply limitation be not reasonable in the case of land at lucas however be about regulatory takings not direct appropriation whatever lucas have to say about reasonable expectation with regard to regulation people still do not expect they property real or personal to be actually occupy or take away we case have stress the longstanding distinction between government acquisition of property and regulation preservation council at the different treatment of real and personal property in a regulatory case suggest by lucas do not alter the established rule of treat direct appropriation of real and personal property alike see at it be inappropriate to treat case involve physical takings as control precedent for the evaluation of a claim that there have be a regulatory taking and vice versa footnote omit the reserve requirement impose by the raisin committee be a clear physical taking actual raisin be transfer from the grower to the government title to the raisin pass to the raisin committee app to pet for cert tr of oral arg the committee raisin must be physically segregate from raisin cfr b reserve raisin be sometimes leave on the premise of handler but they be hold for the account of the government a the committee dispose of what become its raisin as it wish to promote the purpose of the raisin marketing order raisin grower subject to the reserve requirement thus lose the entire bundle of property rights in the appropriate raisin the rights to possess use and dispose of they loretto at internal quotation mark omit with the exception of the speculative hope that some residual proceeds may be leave when the government be do with the raisin and have deduct the expense of implement all aspect of the marketing order the government actual taking of possession and control of the reserve raisin give rise to a take as clearly as if the government hold full title and ownership at internal quotation mark omit as it essentially do the government formal demand that the hornes turn over a percentage of they raisin crop without charge for the government control and use be of such a unique character that it be a take without regard to other factor that a court might ordinarily examine at the government think it strange and the dissent baffle that the hornes object to the reserve requirement when they nonetheless concede that the government may prohibit the sale of raisin without effect a per se take brief for respondent post at sotomayor dissent but that distinction flow naturally from the settle difference in we takings jurisprudence between appropriation and regulation a physical taking of raisin and a regulatory limit on production may have the same economic impact on a grower the constitution however be concern with means as well as end the government have broad power but the mean it use to achieve its end must be consist ent with the letter and spirit of the constitution mcculloch maryland wheat as justice holmes note a strong public desire to improve the public condition be not enough to warrant achieve the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way pennsylvania coal at b the second question present ask whether the government may avoid the categorical duty to pay just compensation for a physical taking of property by reserve to the property owner a contingent interest in a portion of the value of the property set at the government discretion the answer be no the government and dissent argue that raisin be fungible goods whose only value be in the revenue from they sale accord to the government the raisin marketing order leave that interest with the raisin grower after sell reserve raisin and deduct expense and subsidy for exporter the raisin committee return any net proceeds to the grower cfr d a h the government contend that because grower be entitle to these net proceeds they retain the most important property interest in the reserve raisin so there be no take in the first place the dissent agree argue that this possible future revenue mean there have be no take under loretto see post at but when there have be a physical appropriation we do not ask whether it deprive the owner of all economically valuable use of the item take preservation council at see at when the government physically take possession of a interest in property for some public purpose it have a categorical duty to compensate the former owner regardless of whether the interest that be take constitute a entire parcel or merely a part thereof citation omit for example in loretto we hold that the installation of a cable box on a small corner of loretto rooftop be a per se take even though she could of course still sell and economically benefit from the property at the fact that the grower retain a contingent interest of indeterminate value do not mean there have be no physical taking particularly since the value of the interest depend on the discretion of the taker and may be worthless as it be for one of the two year at issue here the dissent point to andrus allard note that the court find no taking in that case even though the owner artifact could not be sell at all post at the dissent suggest that the hornes should be happy because they might at least get something from what have be they raisin but allard be a very different case as the dissent recognize the owner in that case retain the rights to possess donate and devise they property in find no taking the court emphasize that the government do not compel the surrender of the artifact and there be no physical invasion or restraint upon they at here of course the raisin program require physical surrender of the raisin and transfer of title and the grower lose any right to control they disposition the government and dissent again confuse we inquiry concern per se takings with we analysis for regulatory takings a regulatory restriction on use that do not entirely deprive a owner of property rights may not be a take under penn central that be why in pruneyard shopping center robins we hold that a law limit a property owner right to exclude certain speaker from a already publicly accessible shopping center do not take the owner property the owner retain the value of the use of the property as a shopping center largely unimpaired so the regulation do not go too far at quote pennsylvania coal at but once there be a take as in the case of a physical appropriation any payment from the government in connection with that action go at most to the question of just compensation see suitum tahoe regional planning agency scalia concur in part and concur in judgment that be not a issue here the hornes do not receive any net proceeds from raisin committee sale for the year at issue because they have not set aside any reserve raisin in those year and in any event there be no net proceeds in one of they c the third question present ask whether a governmental mandate to relinquish specific identifiable property as a condition on permission to engage in commerce effect a per se take the answer at least in this case be yes the government contend that the reserve requirement be not a take because raisin grower voluntarily choose to participate in the raisin market accord to the government if raisin grower do not like it they can plant different crop or sell they grape as table grape or for use in juice or wine brief for respondent bracket and internal quotation mark omit let they sell wine be probably not much more comforting to the raisin grower than similar retort have be to other throughout history in any event the government be wrong as a matter of law in loretto we reject the argument that the new york law be not a take because a landlord could avoid the requirement by cease to be a landlord we hold instead that a landlord ability to rent he property may not be condition on he forfeit the right to compensation for a physical occupation at as the court explain the contrary argument prove too much for example it would allow the government to require a landlord to devote a substantial portion of he building to vend and wash machine with all profit to be retain by the owner of these service and with no compensation for the deprivation of space it would even allow the government to requisition a certain number of apartment as permanent government office ibid as the court conclude property rights can not be so easily manipulate ibid the government and dissent rely heavily on ruckelshaus monsanto there we hold that the environmental protection agency could require company manufacture pesticide fungicide and rodenticide to disclose health safety and environmental information about they product as a condition to receive a permit to sell those product while such information include trade secret in which pesticide manufacturer have a property interest those manufacturer be not subject to a take because they receive a valuable government benefit in exchange a license to sell dangerous chemical at see nollan at discuss monsanto the take here can not reasonably be characterize as part of a similar voluntary exchange in one of the year at issue here the government insist that the hornes turn over percent of they raisin crop in exchange for the benefit of be allow to sell the remain percent the next year the toll be percent we have already reject the idea that monsanto may be extend by regard basic and familiar use of property as a government benefit on the same order as a permit to sell hazardous chemical see nollan at distinguish monsanto on the ground that the right to build on one own property even though its exercise can be subject to legitimate permit requirement can not remotely be describe as a governmental benefit sell produce in interstate commerce although certainly subject to reasonable government regulation be similarly not a special governmental benefit that the government may hold hostage to be ransom by the waiver of constitutional protection raisin be not dangerous pesticide they be a healthy snack a case about conditioning the sale of hazardous substance on disclosure of health safety and environmental information related to those hazard be hardly on point leonard leonard earle be also readily distinguishable in that case the court uphold a maryland requirement that oyster packer remit ten percent of the marketable detach oyster shell or they monetary equivalent to the state for the privilege of harvest the oyster but the packer do not deny the power of the state to declare they business a privilege and the power of the state to impose a privilege tax be not question by counsel at the oyster unlike raisin be feræ naturæ that belong to the state under state law and n o individual ha d any property rights in they other than such as the state may permit he to acquire leonard earle the oyster packer do not simply seek to sell they property they seek to appropriate the state indeed the maryland court of appeals see the issue as a question of a reasonable and fair compensation from the packer to the state as owner of the oyster at at internal quotation mark omit raisin be not like oyster they be private property the fruit of the grower labor not public thing subject to the absolute control of the state at at any physical taking of they for public use must be accompany by just compensation iii the government correctly point out that a take do not violate the fifth amendment unless there be no just compensation and argue that the hornes be free to seek compensation for any take by bring a damages action under the tucker act in the court of federal claims see a monsanto at but we hold in horne i that the hornes may in they capacity as handler raise a defense to the fine levy against they we specifically reject the contention that the hornes be require to pay the fine and then seek compensation under the tucker act see at slip at we conclude that the agricultural marketing agreement act withdraw tucker act jurisdiction over the hornes takings claim the hornes as handler have no alternative remedy and they takings claim be not premature when present to the ninth circuit as note the hornes be both grower and handler they situation be unusual in that as handler they have the full economic interest in the raisin the government allege should have be set aside for its account they own the raisin they grow and be handle for themselves and they own the raisin they handle for other grower have pay those grower for all they raisin not just the amount as be true with respect to most handler see supra at tr of oral arg the penalty assess against they as handler include the dollar equivalent of the raisin they refuse to set aside they raisin at brief for petitioner they may challenge the imposition of that fine and do not have to pay it first and then resort to the court of federal claims finally the government briefly argue that if we conclude that the reserve requirement effect a taking we should remand for the court of appeals to calculate what compensation would have be due if petitioner have comply with the reserve requirement brief for respondent the government contend that the calculation must consider what the value of the reserve raisin would have be without the price support program as well as other benefit from the regulatory program such as higher consumer demand for raisin spur by enforcement of quality standard and promotional activity at indeed accord to the government the hornes would likely have a net gain under this theory at the best defense may be a good offense but the government cite no support for its approach or its notion that general regulatory activity such as enforcement of quality standard can constitute just compensation for a specific physical taking instead we case have set forth a clear and administrable rule for just compensation the court have repeatedly hold that just compensation normally be to be measure by the market value of the property at the time of the taking united states acre of land quote olson united states justice breyer be concern that apply this rule in this case will affect provision concern whether a condemn authority may deduct special benefit such as new access to a waterway or highway or fill in of swampland from the amount of compensation it seek to pay a landowner suffer a partial taking post at opinion concurring in part and dissent in part see bauman ross lay out of street and subdivision in the district of columbia he need not be case of that sort can raise complicated question involve the exercise of the eminent domain power but they do not create a generally applicable exception to the usual compensation rule base on assert regulatory benefit of the sort at issue here nothing in the case justice breyer label bauman and its progeny post at suggest otherwise which may be why the solicitor general do not cite they in any event this litigation present no occasion to consider the broader issue discuss by justice breyer the government have already calculate the amount of just compensation in this case when it fine the hornes the fair market value of the raisin at the government can not now disavow that valuation see reply brief and do not suggest that the marketing order afford the hornes compensation in that amount there be accordingly no need for a remand the hornes should simply be relieve of the obligation to pay the fine and associate civil penalty they be assess when they resist the government effort to take they raisin this case in litigation for more than a decade have go on long enough the judgment of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit be reverse it be so order thomas concur marvin horne et petitioners department of agriculture on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the ninth circuit june justice thomas concur i join the court opinion in full i write separately to offer a additional observation concern justice breyer argument that we should remand the case the takings clause prohibit the government from take private property except for public use even when it offer just compensation amdt that requirement as originally understand impose a meaningful constraint on the power of the state the government may take property only if it actually use or give the public a legal right to use the property kelo new london thomas dissent it be far from clear that the raisin administrative committee conduct meet that standard it take the raisin of citizen and among other thing give they away or sell they to exporter foreign importer and foreign government cfr b to the extent that the committee be not take the raisin for public use have the court of appeals calculate just compensation in this case would be a fruitless exercise opinion of breyer marvin horne et petitioners department of agriculture on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the ninth circuit june justice breyer with whom justice ginsburg and justice kagan join concur in part and dissent in part i agree with part i and ii of the court opinion however i can not agree with the court rejection in part iii of the government final argument the government contend that we should remand the case for a determination of whether any compensation would have be due if the hornes have comply with the california raisin marketing order reserve requirement in my view a remand for such a determination be necessary the question of just compensation be not present in the hornes petition for certiorarus it be barely touch on in the briefs and the court below do not decide it at the same time the case law that i have find indicate that the government may well be right the marketing order may afford just compensation for the takings of raisin that it impose if that be correct then the reserve requirement do not violate the takings clause i the takings clause of the fifth amendment provide that private property shall not be take for public use without just compensation the clause mean what it say it do not proscribe the taking of property it proscribe take without just compensation williamson county regional planning comm hamilton bank of johnson city emphasis add under the clause a property owner be entitle to be put in as good a position pecuniarily as if he property have not be take which be to say that h e must be make whole but be not entitle to more olson united states on the record before we the hornes have not establish that the government through the raisin reserve program take raisin without just compensation when the government take as reserve raisin a percentage of the annual crop the raisin owner retain the remain raisin the reserve requirement be intend at least in part to enhance the price that raisin will fetch on the open market see cfr and any such enhancement matter this court precedent indicate that when calculate the just compensation that the fifth amendment require a court should deduct from the value of the take reserve raisin any enhancement cause by the take to the value of the remain raisin more than a century ago in bauman ross this court establish a exception to the rule that just compensation normally be to be measure by the market value of the property at the time of the taking united states acre of land quote olson supra at we consider in bauman how to calculate just compensation when the government take only a portion of a parcel of property w hen part only of a parcel of land be take for a highway the value of that part be not the sole measure of the compensation or damages to be pay to the owner but the incidental injury or benefit to the part not take be also to be consider when the part not take be leave in such shape or condition as to be in itself of less value than before the owner be entitle to additional damages on that account when on the other hand the part which he retain be specially and directly increase in value by the public improvement the damages to the whole parcel by the appropriation of part of it be lessen at the constitution of the united states the court state contain no express prohibition against consider benefit in estimate the just compensation to be pay for private property take for the public use at the court have consistently apply this method for calculate just compensation it set off from the value of the portion that be take the value of any benefit confer upon the remain portion of the property see regional rail reorganization act case c onsideration other than cash for example any special benefit to a property owner remain property may be count in the determination of just compensation footnote omit united states miller i f the taking have in fact benefit the remainder the benefit may be set off against the value of the land take united states sponenbarger i f governmental activity inflict slight damage upon land in one respect and actually confer great benefit when measure in the whole to compensate the landowner further would be to grant he a special bounty such activity in substance take nothing from the landowner reichelderfer quinn just compensation be award if the benefit result from the proximity of the improvement be set off against the value of the property take from the same owner dohany rogers a statute that permit deduction of benefit derive from the construction of a highway from the compensation pay to landowner afford s no basis for anticipate that just compensation will be deny norwood baker except for state law the state could have authorize benefit to be deduct from the actual value of the land take without violate the constitutional injunction that compensation be make for private property take for public use for the benefit receive could be properly regard as compensation pro tanto for the property appropriate to public use the rule apply regardless of whether a take enhance the value of one property or the value of many property that be to say the government may permi t consideration of actual benefit enhancement in market value flow directly from a public work although all in the neighborhood receive like advantage mccoy union elevated the federal constitution do not distinguish between special benefit which specifically affect the property take and general benefit which have a broader impact of course a state may prefer to guarantee a greater payment to property owner for instance by establish a standard for compensation that do not account for general benefit or for any benefit afford to a property owner by a taking see at describe category of rule apply in different jurisdiction schopflocher deduction of benefits in determine compensation or damages in eminent domain describe particular rule apply in different jurisdiction similarly congress have the power to authorize compensation greater than the constitutional minimum acre of land supra at thus congress too may limit the type of benefit to be consider see but i be unaware of any congressional authorization that would increase beyond the constitutional floor the compensation owe for a taking of the hornes raisin if we apply bauman and its progeny to the marketing order reserve requirement the benefit to the raisin may be set off against the value of the reserve raisin take miller supra at the value of the raisin take might exceed the value of the benefit confer in that case the reserve requirement effect a taking without just compensation and the hornes decision not to comply with the requirement be justified on the other hand the benefit might equal or exceed the value of the raisin take in that case the california raisin marketing order do not effect a take without just compensation see mccoy supra at in such a case the owner really lose nothing which he have before and it may be say with reason there have be no real injury brown legal foundation of i f petitioner net loss be zero the compensation that be due be also zero and even the hornes agree that if the reserve requirement do not effect a take without just compensation then they can not use the takings clause to excuse they failure to comply with the marketing order or to justify they refusal to pay the fine and penalty impose base on that failure see brief for petitioners the constitutionality of the fine rise or fall on the constitutionality of the marketing order reserve requirement and attendant transfer of reserve raisin internal quotation mark omit ii the majority believe the bauman line of case most likely do not apply here it say that those case do not create a generally applicable exception to the usual compensation rule base on assert regulatory benefit of the sort at issue here ante at but it be unclear to i what distinguish this case from those it seem unlikely that the majority find a distinction in the fact that this taking be base on regulatory authority chrysler brown it have be establish in a variety of context that properly promulgate substantive agency regulation have the force and effect of law internal quotation mark omit it similarly seem unlikely that the majority intend to distinguish between takings of real property and takings of personal property give its recognition that the takings clause protect private property without any distinction between different type ante at it be possible that the majority question the government argument because of its breadth the government argue that it would be appropriate to consider what value all of the raisin would have have in the absence of the marketing order and i be unaware of any precedent that allow a court to account for portion of the marketing order that be entirely separate from the reserve requirement but neither be i aware of any precedent that would distinguish between how the bauman doctrine apply to the reserve requirement itself and how it apply to other type of partial takings ultimately the majority reject the government request for a remand because it believe that the government do not suggest that the marketing order afford the hornes compensation in the amount of the fine that the government assess ante at in my view however the relevant precedent indicate that the takings clause require compensation in a amount equal to the value of the reserve raisin adjust to account for the benefit receive and the government do indeed suggest that the marketing order afford just compensation see brief for respondent it be likely that when all benefit and alleged loss from the marketing order be calculate the hornes would have a net gain rather than a net loss give that a central point of the order be to benefit producer further the hornes have not demonstrate the contrary before grant judgment in favor of the hornes a court should address the issue in light of all of the relevant fact and law give the precedent the party should provide full briefing on this question i would remand the case permit the lower court to consider argument on the question of just compensation for these reason while join part i and ii of the court opinion i respectfully dissent from part iii sotomayor dissent marvin horne et petitioners department of agriculture on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the ninth circuit june justice sotomayor dissent the hornes claim and the court agree that the raisin marketing order cfr pt hereinafter order effect a per se take under we decision in loretto teleprompter manhattan catv but loretto set a high bar for such claim it require that each and every property right be destroy by governmental action before that action can be say to have effect a per se take because the order do not deprive the hornes of all of they property rights it do not effect a per se take i respectfully dissent from the court contrary holding i we takings clause jurisprudence have generally eschew magic formula s and have recognize few invariable rule arkansas game and fish comm united states slip at most takings case therefore proceed under the balancing test set out in penn central transp new york city see arkansas game and fish comm n at slip at lingle chevron the hornes have not make any argument under penn central in order to prevail they therefore must fit they claim into one of the three narrow category in which we have assess takings claim more categorically in the special context of exaction we have hold that government demand that a landowner dedicate a easement allow public access to she property as a condition of obtain a development permit constitute takings unless the government demonstrate a nexus and rough proportionality between its demand and the impact of the propose development lingle at see dolan city of tigard nollan california coastal comm n we have also hold that a regulation that deprive a property owner of all economically beneficial we e of he or she land be a per se take lucas south carolina coastal council emphasis in original the hornes have not rely on either of these rule in this court see brief for petitioner finally and this be the argument the hornes do rely on we have hold that the government effect a per se take when it require a property owner to suffer a permanent physical occupation of he or she property lor etto at in my view however loretto when properly understand do not encompass the circumstance of this case because it only apply where all property rights have be destroy by governmental action where some property right be retain by the owner no per se take under loretto have occur this strict rule be apparent from the reasoning in lor etto itself we explain that p roperty rights in a physical thing have be describe as the rights to possess use and dispose of it at quote united states general motors a permanent physical occupation of property occur we say when governmental action destroy each of these rights at emphasis in original see require that a owner be absolutely dispossess ed of rights when as we hold in loretto each of these rights be destroy the government have not simply take n a single strand from the bundle of property rights it have chop ped through the bundle entirely at in the narrow circumstance in which a property owner have suffer this most serious form of invasion of he or she property interest a take can be say to have occur without any further showing on the property owner part ibid by contrast in the mine run of case where governmental action impact property rights in way that do not chop through the bundle entirely we have decline to apply per se rule and have instead opt for the more nuanced penn central test see hodel irving apply penn central to assess a requirement that title to land within indian reservation escheat to the tribe upon the landowner death pruneyard shopping center robins engage in similar analysis where there be literally a take of th e right to exclude kaiser aetna united states apply penn central to find that the government imposition of a servitude require public access to a pond be a taking see also loretto at distinguish pruneyard and kaiser aetna even governmental action that reduce the value of property or that impose a significant restriction on one means of dispose of property be not a per se take in fact it may not even be a take at all andrus allard what we jurisprudence thus make plain be that a claim of a loretto taking be a bold accusation that carry with it a heavy burden to qualify as a per se take under lor etto the governmental action must be so completely destructive to the property owner rights all of they as to render the ordinary generally applicable protection of the penn central framework either a foregone conclusion or unequal to the task simply put the retention of even one property right that be not destroy be sufficient to defeat a claim of a per se take under loretto ii a when evaluate the order under this rubric it be important to bear two thing in mind the first be that lor etto be not concern with whether the order be a good idea now whether it be ever a good idea or whether it intrude upon some property rights the order may well be a outdate and by some light downright silly regulation it be also no doubt intrusive but whatever else one can say about the order it be not a per se take if it do not result in the destruction of every property right the second thing to keep in mind be the need for precision about whose property rights be at issue and about what property be at issue here what be at issue be the hornes property rights in the raisin they own and that be subject to the reserve requirement the order therefore effect a per se take under loretto if and only if each of the hornes property rights in the portion of raisin that the order designate as reserve have be destroy if not then whatever fate the order may reach under some other takings test it be not a per se take the hornes however retain at least one meaningful property interest in the reserve raisin the right to receive some money for they disposition the order explicitly provide that raisin producer retain the right to t he net proceeds from the disposition of reserve tonnage raisin cfr h and ensure that reserve raisin will be sell at price and in a manner intend to maxim ize producer return d accord to the government of the crop year for which a reserve pool be operative producer receive equitable distribution of net proceeds from the disposition of reserve raisin in see letter from donald verrilli solicitor general to scott harris clerk of court grant this equitable distribution may represent less income than what some or all of the reserve raisin could fetch if sell in a unregulated market in some year it may even turn out and have turn out to represent no net income but whether and when that occur turn on market force for which the government can not be blame and to which all commodity indeed all property be subject in any event we have emphasize that a reduction in the value of property be not necessarily equate with a taking andrus at that even a significant restriction impose on one means of dispose of property be not necessarily a take at and that not every injury to property by governmental action amount to a taking pruneyard at indeed we would not have use the word destroy in loretto if we mean damage or even substantially damage i take we at we word loretto strict requirement that all property interest be destroy ed by governmental action before that action can be call a per se take can not be satisfy if there remain a property interest that be at most merely damage that be the case here accordingly no per se taking have occur moreover when as here the property at issue be a fungible commodity for sale the income that the property may yield be the property owner most central interest ruckelshaus monsanto note that the nature of particular property define the extent of the property right therein a rticle of commerce in other word be desirable because they be convertible into money leonard leonard earle the hornes do not use the raisin that be subject to the reserve requirement which be again the only raisin that have allegedly be unlawfully take by eat they feed they to farm animal or the like they wish to use those reserve raisin by sell they and they value those raisin only because they be a means of acquire money while the order infringe upon the amount of that potential income it do not inexorably eliminate it unlike the law in loretto see at the order therefore can not be say to have prevent the hornes from make any use of the relevant property the conclusion that the order do not effect a per se take fit comfortably within we precedent after all we have observe that even r egulation that bar trade in certain goods altogether for example a ban on the sale of eagle feather may survive takings challenge andrus at to be sure it be important to we decision in andrus that the regulation at issue do not prohibit the possession donation or devise of the property see at but as to those feather the plaintiff would have like to sell the law say they could not be sell at any price and therefore categorically could not be convert into money here too the hornes may do as they wish with the raisin they be not sell but as to those raisin that they would like to sell the order subject a subset of they to the reserve requirement which allow for the conversion of reserve raisin into at least some money and which be thus more generous than the law in andrus we hold that no take occur in andrus so reject the hornes claim follow a fortiori we make this principle even clearer in lucas when we rely on andrus and say that where as here property only economically productive use be sale or manufacture for sale a regulation could even render that property economically worthless without effect a per se take lucas at cite andrus at emphasis add the order do not go nearly that far it should easily escape we approbation at least where a per se takings claim be concern b the fact that at least one property right be not destroy by the order be alone sufficient to hold that this case do not fall within the narrow confines of loretto but such a holding be also consistent with another line of case that when view together teach that the government may require certain property rights to be give up as a condition of entry into a regulated market without effect a per se take first in leonard leonard earle we consider a state law that require those who wish to engage in the business of oyster packing to deliver to the state percent of the empty oyster shell we reject the argument that this law effect a taking and hold that it be not materially different from a tax upon the privilege of do business in the state at a be the packer lawfully could be require to pay that sum in money we say nothing in the federal constitution prevent the state from demand that he give up the same per cent of such shell ibid next in ruckelshaus monsanto we hold that no take occur when a provision of the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act require company that wish to sell certain pesticide to first submit sensitive datum and trade secret to the environmental protection agency as part of a registration process even though the epa be permit to publicly disclose some of that submit datum which would have have the effect of reveal trade secret thus substantially diminish or perhaps even eliminate they value we reason that like the privilege tax in leonard leonard the disclosure requirement be the price monsanto have to pay for the advantage of living and do business in a civilized community at quote andrus at some internal quotation mark omit we offer nary a suggestion that the law at issue could be consider a per se take and instead recognize that a voluntary submission of datum by a applicant in exchange for the ability to participate in a regulated market can hardly be call a taking at finally in yee escondido we address a park ordinance that set rent at rate we hold the ordinance do not effect a take under loretto even when it be consider in conjunction with other state law regard eviction that effectively permit tenant to remain at will because it only regulate the term of market participation see at understand together these case demonstrate that the government may condition the ability to offer goods in the market on the of certain property interest without effect a per se take the order be a similar regulation it have no effect whatsoever on raisin that the hornes grow for they own use but insofar as the hornes wish to sell some raisin in a market regulate by the government and at a price support by governmental intervention the order require that they give up the right to sell a portion of those raisin at that price and instead accept disposal of they at a lower price give that we have hold that the government may impose a price on the privilege of engage in a particular business without effect a take which be all that the order do it follow that the order at the very least do not run afoul of we per se takings jurisprudence under a different takings test one might reach a different conclusion but the hornes have advance only this narrow per se takings claim and that claim fail iii the court contrary conclusion rest upon two fundamental error the first be the court breezy assertion that a per se taking have occur because the hornes lose the entire bundle of property rights in the appropriate raisin with the exception of the retain interest in the equitable distribution of the proceeds from the disposition of the reserve raisin ante at but if there be a property right that have not be lose as the court concede there be then the order have not destroy each of the hornes rights in the reserve raisin and do not effect a per se take the court protest that the retain interest be not substantial or certain enough but while i see more value in that interest than the court do the bottom line be that loretto do not distinguish among retain property interest that be substantial or certain enough to count and other that be not nor be it at all clear how the court approach will be administrable how after all be court government or individual suppose to know how much a property owner must be leave with before this court will bless the retain interest as sufficiently meaningful and certain one virtue of the loretto test be at least until today its clarity under loretto a total destruction of all property rights constitute a per se take anything less do not see at note the very narrow nature of the loretto framework among the most significant doctrinal damage that the court cause be the blur of this otherwise bright line and the expansion of this otherwise narrow category by the court light perhaps a percent destruction of property rights can be a per se take perhaps perhaps so long as the remain be view by a review court as less than meaningful and what make a retain right meaningful enough one wonder indeed it be not at all clear what test the court have actually apply such confusion would be bad enough in any context but it be especially pernicious in the area of property rights property owner should be assure of where they stand and the government need to know how far it can permissibly go without trip over a categorical rule the second overarching error in the court opinion arise from its reliance on what it view as the uniquely physical nature of the take effect by the order this it say be why many of the case have to do with regulatory takings be inapposite see ante at it be not the case however that government agent act pursuant to the order be storm raisin farm in the dark of night to load raisin onto truck but see tr of oral arg remark of roberts the order simply require the hornes to set aside a portion of they raisin a requirement with which the hornes refuse to comply see cfr b tr of oral arg and it do so to facilitate two classic regulatory goal one be the regulatory purpose of limit the quantity of raisin that can be sell on the market the other be the regulatory purpose of arrange the orderly disposition of those raisin whose sale would otherwise exceed the cap the hornes and the court both concede that a cap on the quantity of raisin that the hornes can sell would not be a per se take see ante at brief for petitioner the court focus on the physical nature of the intrusion also suggest that merely arrange for the sale of the reserve raisin would not be a per se take the rub for the court must therefore be not that the government be do these thing but that it be accomplish they by the altogether understandable requirement that the reserve raisin be physically set aside i know of no principle however provide that if the government achieve a permissible regulatory end by ask regulate individual or entity to physically move the property subject to the regulation it have commit a per se take rather than a potential regulatory taking after all in monsanto the datum that the pesticide company have to turn over to the government be presumably turn over in some physical form yet even the court do not call monsanto a physical takings case it therefore can not be that any regulation that involve the slightest physical movement of property be necessarily evaluate as a per se take rather than as a regulatory taking the combined effect of these error be to unsettle a important area of we jurisprudence unable to justify its hold under we precedent the court resort to superimpose new limitation on those precedent stretch the otherwise strict loretto test into a unadministrable one and deem regulatory takings jurisprudence irrelevant in some undefined set of case involve government regulation of property rights and it do all of this in service of eliminate a type of reserve requirement that be applicable to just a few commodity in the entire country and that in any event commodity producer could vote to terminate if they wish see letter from solicitor general to clerk of court b cfr c this intervention hardly strike i as worth the cost but what make the court twist of the doctrine even more baffling be that it ultimately instruct the government that it can permissibly achieve its market control goal by impose a quota without offer raisin producer a way of reap any return whatsoever on the raisin they can not sell i have trouble understand why anyone would prefer that because a straightforward application of we precedent reveal that the hornes have not suffer a per se take i would affirm the judgment of the ninth circuit the court reach a contrary conclusion only by expand we per se takings doctrine in a manner that be as unwarranted as it be vague i respectfully dissent footnote footnote for example in united states miller the court in calculate the fair market value of land discount a increase in value result from speculation as to what the govern ment would be compel to pay as compensation after the land be earmark for acquisition in united states sponenbarger the court determine there be no take in the first place when the complaint be merely that a government flood control plan provide insufficient protection for the claimant land mccoy union elevated similarly involve a claim for damages to property not actually take so too reichelderfer quinn there the court hold that claimant who have pay a special assessment when rock creek park in washington be create because the park increase the value of they property do not thereby have the right to prevent congress from alter use of part of the park for a fire station year later in dohany rogers the law authorize the take do not permit the offset of benefit for a railroad and therefore be not subject to the objection that it fail to provide adequate compensation and be therefore unconstitutional at and quote fitzsimons galvin rogers and in norwood baker the issue be whether a assessment to pay for improvement exceed a village tax power perhaps farthest afield be the regional rail reorganization act case which involve valuation question arise from the government reorganization of northeast and midwest railroad the court in that case hold that the legislation at issue be not merely a eminent domain statute but instead be enact pursuant to the bankruptcy power at footnote footnote the court attempt to distinguish leonard leonard because it involve wild oyster not raisin ante at that be not a inaccurate factual statement but i do not find in leonard leonard any suggestion that its holding turn on this or any other of the fact to which the court now point indeed the only citation the court offer for these allegedly crucial fact be the maryland court
