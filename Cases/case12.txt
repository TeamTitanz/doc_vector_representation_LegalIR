in congress enact the homeland security act stat that act provide that the transportation security administration tsa shall prescribe regulation prohibit the disclosure of information if the under secretary decide that disclosur e would be detrimental to the security of transportation r c around the same time the tsa promulgate regulation prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive security information fed reg which include s pecific detail of aviation security measure such as information concern specific number of federal air marshals deployment or mission and the method involve in such operation cfr j in july the tsa brief all federal air marshal include robert maclean about a potential plot to hijack passenger flight a few day after the briefing maclean receive from the tsa a text message cancel all overnight mission from las vegas until early august maclean who be station in las vegas believe that cancel those mission during a hijacking alert be dangerous and illegal he therefore contact a reporter and tell he about the tsa decision to cancel the mission after discover that maclean be the source of the disclosure the tsa fire he for disclose sensitive security information without authorization maclean challenge he firing before the merit systems protection board he argue that he disclosure be whistleblowing activity under b a which protect employee who disclose information that reveal any violation of any law rule or regulation or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety the board hold that maclean do not qualify for protection under that statute because he disclosure be specifically prohibit by law b a namely by r the court of appeals for the federal circuit vacate the board decision hold that section r be not a prohibition hold maclean disclosure be not specifically prohibit by law a the government argue that maclean disclosure be specifically prohibit by law in two way first by the tsa regulation on sensitive security information and second by section r itself which authorize the tsa to promulgate those regulation i maclean disclosure be not prohibit by the tsa regulation for purpose of section b a because regulation do not qualify as law under that statute throughout section congress repeatedly use the phrase law rule or regulation but congress do not use that phrase in the statutory language at issue here it use the word law standing alone congress choice to say specifically prohibit by law instead of specifically prohibit by law rule or regulation suggest that congress mean to exclude rule and regulation in addition section b a create a second exception for disclosure require by executive order to be keep secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affair that the second exception be limit to action by the president himself suggest that the first exception do not include action take by executive agency finally interpret the word law to include rule and regulation could defeat the purpose of the whistleblower statute that interpretation would allow a agency to insulate itself from section b a simply by promulgate a regulation that specifically prohibit all whistleblowing the government propose two alternative interpretation but neither be persuasive first the government argue that the word law include all regulation that have the force and effect of law the government basis this argument on the decision in chrysler brown where this court hold that legislative regulation generally fall within the meaning of the word law unless there be a clear showing of contrary legislative intent at but congress use of the word law in close connection with the phrase law rule or regulation provide the necessary clear showing that law do not include regulation in this case second the government argue that the word law include at least those regulation that be promulgate pursuant to a express congressional directive the government however be unable to find a single example of the word law be use in that way ii likewise maclean disclosure be not prohibit by section r that statute do not prohibit anything instead it authorize the tsa to prescribe regulation thus by its term section r do not prohibit the disclosure here the government respond that section r do prohibit maclean disclosure by impose a legislative mandate on the tsa to promulgate regulation to that effect but the statute afford substantial discretion to the tsa in decide whether to prohibit any particular disclosure thus it be the tsa regulation not the statute that prohibit maclean disclosure and those regulation do not qualify as law under section b a b the government argue that provide whistleblower protection to individual like maclean would gravely endanger public safety by make the confidentiality of sensitive security information depend on the idiosyncratic judgment of each of the tsa employee those concern be legitimate but they must be address by congress or the president rather than by this court affirm roberts deliver the opinion of the court in which scalia thomas ginsburg breyer alito and kagan join sotomayor file a dissenting opinion in which kennedy join opinion of the court notice this opinion be subject to formal revision before publication in the preliminary print of the united states reports reader be request to notify the reporter of decision supreme court of the united states washington of any typographical or other formal error in order that correction may be make before the preliminary print go to press department of homeland security petitioner robert maclean on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the federal circuit january chief justice roberts deliver the opinion of the court federal law generally provide whistleblower protection to a employee who disclose information reveal any violation of any law rule or regulation or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety b a a exception exist however for disclosure that be specifically prohibit by law ibid here a federal air marshal publicly disclose that the transportation security administration tsa have to cut cost by remove air marshal from certain flight the question present be whether that disclosure be specifically prohibit by law i a in congress enact the homeland security act stat as relevant here that act provide that the tsa shall prescribe regulation prohibit the disclosure of information obtain or develop in carry out security if the under secretary decide that disclose the information would be detrimental to the security of transportation r c around the same time the tsa promulgate regulation prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of what it call sensitive security information see fed reg the regulation describe category of sensitive security information include s pecific detail of aviation security measure such as information concern specific number of federal air marshals deployment or mission and the method involve in such operation cfr j sensitive security information be not classify so the tsa can share it with individual who do not have a security clearance such as airport employee compare exec order cfr comp with cfr c b robert maclean become a federal air marshal for the tsa in in that role maclean be assign to protect passenger flight from potential hijacking see a on july the department of homeland security dhs issue a confidential advisory about a potential hijacking plot the advisory say that member of the terrorist group al qaeda be plan to attack passenger flight and that they consider suicide hijacking and bombing as the most promising method to destroy aircraft in flight as well as to strike ground target app the advisory identify a number of potential target include the united kingdom italy australia and the east coast of the united states finally the advisory warn that at least one of the attack could be execute by the end of the summer ibid the tsa soon summon all air marshal include maclean for briefing about the hijacking plot during maclean briefing a tsa official tell he that the hijacker be plan to smuggle weapon in camera equipment or child toy through foreign security and then fly into the united states into a airport that do not require they to be screen at the hijacker would then board flight overpower the crew or the air marshals and fly the plane into east coast target at a few day after the briefing maclean receive from the tsa a text message cancel all overnight mission from las vegas until early august maclean who be station in las vegas believe that cancel those mission during a hijacking alert be dangerous he also believe that the cancellation be illegal give that federal law require the tsa to put a air marshal on every flight that present s high security risk a and provide that nonstop long distance flight such as those target on september should be a priority b see app maclean therefore ask a supervisor why the tsa have cancel the mission the supervisor respond that the tsa want to save money on hotel cost because there be no more money in the budget at maclean also call the dhs inspector general office to report the cancellation but a special agent in that office tell he there be nothing that could be do at unwilling to accept those response maclean contact a msnbc reporter and tell he about the cancel mission in turn the reporter publish a story about the tsa decision title air marshals pull from key flight at the story report that air marshal would no longer be cover or international flight because the agency do not want they to incur the expense of stay overnight in hotel ibid the story also report that the cancellation be particularly disturb to some because they coincide d with a new hijacking threat issue by the department of homeland security at after msnbc publish the story several member of congress criticize the cancellation within hour the tsa reverse its decision and put air marshal back on the flight at at first the tsa do not know that maclean be the source of the disclosure in september however maclean appear on nbc nightly news to criticize the tsa dress code for air marshal which he believe make they too easy to identify although maclean appear in disguise several recognize he voice and the tsa begin investigate the appearance during that investigation maclean admit that he have disclose the text message back in consequently in april the tsa fire maclean for disclose sensitive security information without authorization maclean challenge he firing before the merit systems protection board argue in relevant part that he disclosure be protect whistleblowing activity under b a the board hold that maclean do not qualify for protection under that statute however because he disclosure be specifically prohibit by law mspr the court of appeals for the federal circuit vacate the board decision the party have agree that in order for maclean disclosure to be specifically prohibit by law it must have be prohibit by a statute rather than by a regulation at emphasis add thus the issue before the court be whether the statute authorize the tsa regulation now codify at r specifically prohibit maclean disclosure at the court first hold that section r be not a prohibition the statute do not expressly prohibit employee disclosure the court explain but instead empower the tsa to prescribe regulation prohibit disclosure s if the tsa decide that disclose the information would harm public safety at the court therefore conclude that maclean disclosure be prohibit by a regulation which the party have agree could not be a law under section b a ibid the court then hold that even if section r be a prohibition it be not sufficiently specific ibid the court explain that a law be sufficiently specific only if it require that matter be withhold from the public as to leave no discretion on the issue or establish particular criterion for withholding or refer to particular type of matter to be withhold ibid quote and section r do not meet that test because it provide d only general criterion for withhold information and give some discretion to the tsa to fashion regulation for prohibit disclosure at the court accordingly vacate the board decision and remand for a determination of whether maclean disclosure meet the other requirement under section b a at we grant certiorari ii section b provide in relevant part that a federal agency may not take a personnel action with respect to any employee or applicant for employment because of a any disclosure of information by a employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believe evidence i any violation of any law rule or regulation or ii gross mismanagement a gross waste of fund a abuse of authority or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety if such disclosure be not specifically prohibit by law and if such information be not specifically require by executive order to be keep secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affair the government argue that this whistleblower statute do not protect maclean because he disclosure regard the cancel mission be specifically prohibit by law in two way first the government argue that the disclosure be specifically prohibit by the tsa regulation on sensitive security information cfr a b j second the government argue that the disclosure be specifically prohibit by r which authorize the tsa to those regulation we address each argument in turn a in the tsa regulation prohibit the disclosure of s pecific detail of aviation security measure such as information concern specific number of federal air marshals deployment or mission and the method involve in such operation cfr j maclean do not dispute before this court that the tsa regulation prohibit he disclosure regard the cancel mission thus the question here be whether a disclosure that be specifically prohibit by regulation be also specifically prohibit by law under section b a emphasis add the answer be no throughout section congress repeatedly use the phrase law rule or regulation for example section b e prohibit a federal agency from discriminate against a employee on the basis of marital status or political affiliation as prohibit under any law rule or regulation for another example section b prohibit a agency from grant ing any preference or advantage not authorize by law rule or regulation and for a third example section b a prohibit a agency from retaliate against a employee for the exercise of any appeal complaint or grievance right grant by any law rule or regulation in contrast congress do not use the phrase law rule or regulation in the statutory language at issue here it use the word law standing alone that be significant because congress generally act intentionally when it use particular language in one section of a statute but omit it in another russello united states thus congress choice to say specifically prohibit by law rather than specifically prohibit by law rule or regulation suggest that congress mean to exclude rule and regulation the interpretive canon that congress act intentionally when it omit language include elsewhere apply with particular force here for two reason first congress use law and law rule or regulation in close proximity indeed in the same sentence b a protect the disclosure of any violation of any law rule or regulation if such disclosure be not specifically prohibit by law second congress use the broader phrase law rule or regulation repeatedly nine time in section alone see a d i b e b b a i b b i b a b b d those two aspect of the whistleblower statute make congress choice to use the narrower word law seem quite deliberate we draw the same inference in department of treasury irs flra there the government argue that the word law in one section of the civil service reform act of mean the same thing as the phrase law rule or regulation in another section of the act at we reject that argument as contrary to any reasonable interpretation of the text at indeed we hold that a statute that refer to law in one section and law rule or regulation in another can not unless we abandon all pretense at precise communication be deem to mean the same thing in both place ibid that inference be even more compelling here because the statute refer to law and law rule or regulation in the same sentence rather than several section apart another part of the statutory text point the same way after create a exception for disclosure specifically prohibit by law section b a go on to create a second exception for information specifically require by executive order to be keep secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affair this exception be limit to action take directly by the president that suggest that the word law in the only other exception be limit to action by congress after all it would be unusual for the first exception to include action take by executive agency when the second exception require action by the president himself in addition a broad interpretation of the word law could defeat the purpose of the whistleblower statute if law include agency rule and regulation then a agency could insulate itself from the scope of section b a merely by promulgate a regulation that specifically prohibit whistleblowing but congress pass the whistleblower statute precisely because it do not trust agency to regulate whistleblower within they rank thus it be unlikely that congress mean to include rule and regulation within the word law the government admit that some regulation fall outside the word law as use in section b a but the government say that do not mean that all regulation be exclude the government suggest two interpretation that would distinguish law from law rule or regulation but would still allow the word law to subsume the tsa regulation on sensitive security information first the government argue that the word law include all regulation that have the force and effect of law legislative regulation while exclude those that do not interpretive rule brief for petitioner the government basis this argument on we decision in chrysler brown there we hold that legislative regulation generally fall within the meaning of the word law and that it would take a clear showing of contrary legislative intent before we conclude otherwise at thus because the tsa regulation have the force and effect of law the government say that they should qualify as law under the statute the government description of chrysler be accurate enough but congress use of the word law in close connection with the phrase law rule or regulation provide the necessary clear showing that law do not include regulation indeed use law and law rule or regulation in the same sentence would be a very obscure way of draw the government nuanced distinction between different type of regulation have congress want to draw that distinction there be far easier and clearer way to do so for example at the time congress pass section b a another federal statute define the word regulatory order to include a rule or regulation if it have the force and effect of law a ed likewise another federal statute define the word state law to include all law decision rule regulation or other state action have the effect of law c ed as those example show congress know how to distinguish between regulation that have the force and effect of law and those that do not but choose not to do so in section b a second the government argue that the word law include at least those regulation that be promulgate pursuant to a express congressional directive brief for petitioner outside of this case however the government be unable to find a single example of the word law be use in that way not a single dictionary definition not a single statute not a single case the government interpretation happen to fit this case precisely but it need more than that to recommend it although the government argue here that the word law include rule and regulation it definitively that argument in the court of appeals for example the government brief accept that the word law mean legislative enactment and say that the only dispute be whether r serve d as that legislative enactment brief for respondent in ca fed then at oral argument a judge ask the government attorney the follow question i think i understand you brief to concede that the word law can not be a rule or regulation it mean statute be i wrong the government attorney respond you be not wrong you honor i will be as clear as i can specifically prohibit by law here mean statute oral arg audio in at see also at now as we have be discuss here we be not say here that the word law need to encompass regulation we be say statute those concession reinforce we conclusion that the government propose interpretation be unpersuasive in sum when congress use the phrase specifically prohibit by law instead of specifically prohibit by law rule or regulation it mean to exclude rule and regulation we therefore hold that the tsa regulation do not qualify as law for purpose of section b a b we next consider whether maclean disclosure regard the cancel mission be specifically prohibit by r itself as relevant here that statute provide that the tsa shall prescribe regulation prohibit the disclosure of information obtain or develop in carry out security if the under secretary decide that disclose the information would be detrimental to the security of transportation r c this statute do not prohibit anything on the it authorize something it authorize the under secretary to prescribe regulation thus by its term section r do not prohibit the disclosure at issue here the government respond that section r do prohibit maclean disclosure by impose a legislative mandate on the tsa to promulgate regulation to that effect see brief for petitioner see also post at sotomayor dissent but the government push the statute too far section r say that the tsa shall prohibit disclosure only if the under secretary decide that disclose the information would be detrimental to the security of transportation r c emphasis add that language afford substantial discretion to the tsa in decide whether to prohibit any particular disclosure the dissent try to downplay the scope of that discretion view it as the almost ministerial task of identify whether a particular piece of information fall within the scope of congress command post at but determine which document meet the statutory standard of detrimental to the security of transportation require the exercise of considerable judgment for example the government say that section r require the under secretary to prohibit disclosure like maclean the government also say however that the statute do not require the under secretary to prohibit a employee from disclose that federal air marshal will be absent from important flight but decline to specify which flight reply brief that distinction come not from section r itself but from the under secretary exercise of discretion it be the tsa regulation not the statute that prohibit maclean disclosure and as the dissent agree a regulation do not count as law under the whistleblower statute see post at the government insist however that this grant of discretion do not make section r any less of a prohibition in support the government rely on administrator faa robertson that case involve the freedom of information act foia which require federal agency to disclose information upon request unless among other thing the information be specifically exempt from disclosure by statute b in robertson we hold that the federal aviation act of be one such statute because it give the federal aviation administration faa a broad degree of discretion in decide whether to disclose or withhold information at the government try to analogize that case to this one in robertson the government say the faa discretion whether to disclose information do not preclude a finding that the information be specifically exempt from disclosure by statute so too here the government say the tsa discretion whether to prohibit disclosure of information do not preclude a finding that the information be specifically prohibit from disclosure by section r see brief for petitioner this analogy fail foia and section b a differ in a important way the provision of foia at issue involve information that be exempt from disclosure while section b a involve information that be prohibit from disclosure a statute that exempt information from mandatory disclosure may nonetheless give the
