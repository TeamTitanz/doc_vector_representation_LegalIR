congress and the environmental protection agency epa or agency have over the course of several decade make many effort to deal with the complex challenge of curtail air pollution emit in upwind state but cause harm in other downwind states as relevant here the clean air act caa or act direct epa to establish national ambient air quality standard naaq for pollutant at level that will protect public health once epa settle on a naaqs the agency must designate nonattainment area location where the concentration of a regulate pollutant exceed the naaqs d each state must submit a state implementation plan or sip to epa within three year of any new or revise naaqs a from the date epa determine that a state sip be inadequate the agency have two year to promulgate a federal implementation plan or fip c among other component the caa mandate sip compliance with the good neighbor provision which require sip to contain adequate provision prohibit any source or other type of emission activity within the state from emit any air pollutant in amount which will contribute significantly to nonattainment in or interfere with maintenance by any other state with respect to any naaqs a d i several time over the past two decade epa have attempt to delineate the good neighbor provision scope by identify when upwind state contribute significantly to nonattainment downwind the circuit find fault with the agency attempt the clean air interstate rule or cair which regulate both nitrogen oxide nox and sulfur dioxide emission the gas at issue here the circuit nevertheless leave cair temporarily in place while encourage epa to act with dispatch in deal with problem the court have identify epa response to that decision be the air pollution rule transport rule which curb nox and emission in upwind state to achieve downwind attainment of three naaq under the transport rule a upwind state contribute d significantly to downwind nonattainment to the extent its export pollution both produce one percent or more of a naaqs in at least one downwind state and could be eliminate as determine by epa upwind states be oblige to eliminate only emission meet both of these criterion through complex modeling epa create a annual emission budget for each regulate state upwind represent the total quantity of pollution a upwind state could produce in a given year under the transport rule have earlier determine each regulate state sip to be inadequate epa contemporaneous with the transport rule promulgate fip allocate each state emission budget among its pollution source a group of state and local government state respondent join by industry and labor group industry respondent petition for review of the transport rule in the circuit the court vacate the rule in its entirety hold that epa action exceed the agency statutory authority in two respects acknowledge that epa fip authority be generally trigger when the agency disapprove a sip the court be nevertheless concern that states would be incapable of fulfil the good neighbor provision without prior epa guidance the court thus conclude that epa must give states a reasonable opportunity to allocate they emission budget before issue fip the court also find the agency interpretation of the good neighbor provision unreasonable conclude that epa must disregard cost and consider exclusively each upwind state physically proportionate responsibility for air quality problem downwind hold the caa do not command that states be give a second opportunity to file a sip after epa have quantify the state interstate pollution obligation a the state respondent do not challenge epa disapproval of any particular sip instead they argue that notwithstanding these disapproval the agency be still oblige to grant upwind states anadditional opportunity to promulgate adequate sip after epa have set the state emission budget this claim do not turn on the validity of the prior sip disapproval but on whether the caa require epa do more than disapprove a sip to trigger the agency authority to issue a fip b the caa plain text support the agency disapproval of a sip without more trigger epa obligation to issue a fip the statute set precise deadline for the states and epa once epa issue any new or revise naaqs a state shall propose a sip within three year a and that sip shall include inter alia provision adequate to satisfy the good neighbor provision a if the epa find a sip inadequate the agency have a statutory duty to issue a fip at any time within two year c however sensible the circuit exception to this strict time prescription may be a review court task be to apply the text of the statute not to improve upon it pavelic leflore marvel entertainment group div of cadence industries nothing in the act differentiate the good neighbor provision from the several other matter a state must address in its sip nor do the act condition the duty to promulgate a fip on epa have first quantify a upwind state good neighbor obligation by alter congress sip and fip schedule the circuit allow a delay congress do not order and place a information submission obligation on epa congress do not impose c the fact that epa have previously accord upwind state a chance to allocate emission budget among they source do not show that the agency act arbitrarily by refrain to do so here epa retain discretion to alter its course provide it give a reasonable explanation for do so motor vehicle mfrs of united states state farm mut automobile ins here the agency have be admonish by the circuit to act with dispatch in amend or replace cair endeavor to satisfy that directive epa act speedily issue fip and the transport rule contemporaneously epa allocation of emission reduction among upwind states be a permissible workable and equitable interpretation of the good neighbor provision a respondent attack on epa interpretation of the good neighbor provision be not foreclose by d b which provide that o nly a objection to a rule raise with reasonable specificity during the period for public comment may be raise during judicial review even assume that respondent fail to object to the transport rule with reasonable specificity that lapse be not jurisdictional section d b be a mandatory but not jurisdictional rule see arbaugh y h which speak to a party procedural obligation not a court authority see kontrick ryan because epa do not press this argument unequivocally before the circuit it do not pose a impassable hindrance to this court review b this court routinely accord dispositive effect to a agency reasonable interpretation of ambiguous statutory language the good neighbor provision delegate authority to epa at least as certainly as the caa provision involve in chevron natural resources defense council epa authority to reduce upwind pollution extend only to those amount of pollution that contribute significantly to nonattainment in downwind states a d i because a downwind state excess pollution be often cause by multiple upwind states however epa must address how to allocate responsibility among multiple contributor the good neighbor provision do not dictate a method of apportionment nothing in the provision for example direct the proportional allocation method advance by the circuit a method that work neither mathematically nor in practical application under chevron congress silence effectively delegate authority to epa to select from among reasonable option see united states mead epa choose allocation method be a permissible construction of the statute chevron at the agency task with choose which among equal amount to eliminate have choose sensibly to reduce the amount easier less costly to eradicate the industry respondent argue that the final calculation can not rely on cost but nothing in the good neighbor provision text preclude that choice and use cost in the transport rule calculus be a efficient and equitable solution to the allocation problem the good neighbor provision compel the agency to address efficient because epa can achieve the same level of attainment of emission reduction the proportional approach aim to achieve but at a much lower overall cost equitable because by impose uniform cost threshold on regulated states epa rule subject to stricter regulation those states that have do less in the past to control they pollution c wholesale invalidation of the transport rule be not justify by either of the circuit remain objection that the transport rule leave open the possibility that a state might be compel to reduce emission beyond the point at which every affect downwind state be in attainment and that epa use of cost do not foreclose the possibility that a upwind state would be require to reduce its emission by so muchthat the state would be place below the mark epa set as the initial threshold of significan ce first instance of in particular downwind location may be incidental to reduction necessary to ensure attainment elsewhere as the good neighbor provision seek attainment in every downwind state however exceed attainment in one state can not rank as unless unnecessary to achieve attainment in any downwind state second the epa must have leeway in fulfil its statutory mandate to balance the possibility of and to maximize achievement of attainment downwind finally in a voluminous record involve thousand of linkage respondent point to only a few instance of unnecessary emission reduction and even those be contest by epa reverse and remand ginsburg deliver the opinion of the court in which roberts and kennedy breyer sotomayor and kagan join scalia file a dissenting opinion in which thomas join alito take no part in the consideration or decision of the case opinion of the court notice this opinion be subject to formal revision before publication in the preliminary print of the united states reports reader be request to notify the reporter of decision supreme court of the united states washington of any typographical or other formal error in order that correction may be make before the preliminary print go to press and et et and et et on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the district of columbia circuit april justice ginsburg deliver the opinion of the court these case concern the effort of congress and the environmental protection agency epa or agency to cope with a complex problem air pollution emit in one state but cause harm in other states leave unregulated the emit or upwind state reap the benefit of the economic activity cause the pollution without bear all the cost see revesz federalism and interstate environmental externality conversely downwind states to which the pollution travels be unable to achieve clean air because of the influx of pollution they lack authority to control see to tackle the problem congress include a good neighbor provision in the clean air act act or caa that provision in its current phrasing instruct states to prohibit source from emit any air pollutant in amount which will contribute significantly to downwind states nonattainment or interfere with maintenance of any national air quality standard a d i interpret the good neighbor provision epa adopt the air pollution rule commonly and hereinafter call the transport rule the rule call for consideration of cost among other factor when determine the emission reduction a upwind state must make to improve air quality in polluted downwind area the court of appeals for the circuit vacate the rule in its entirety it hold to that the good neighbor provision require epa to consider only each upwind state physically proportionate responsibility for each downwind state air quality problem that reading be demand accord to the circuit so that no state will be require to decrease its emission by more than its ratable share of pollution in chevron natural resources defense council we reverse a circuit decision that fail to accord deference to epa reasonable interpretation of a ambiguous clean air act provision satisfy that the good neighbor provision do not command the court of appeals construction and that epa reasonably interpret the provision we reverse the circuit judgment i a air pollution be transient heedless of state boundary pollutant generate by upwind source be often transport by air current sometimes over hundred of mile to downwind states as the pollution travel out of state upwind state be relieve of the associate cost those cost be bear instead by the downwind states whose ability to achieve and maintain satisfactory air quality be hamper by the steady stream of infiltrate pollution for several reason curtail interstate air pollution pose a complex challenge for environmental regulator first identify the upwind origin of downwind air pollution be no easy endeavor most upwind states propel pollutant to more than one downwind state many downwind states receive pollution from multiple upwind states and some states qualify as both upwind and downwind see brief for federal petitioners the overlap and interwoven linkage between upwind and downwind state with which epa have to contend number in the thousand further complicate the problem pollutant do not emerge from the smokestack of a upwind state and uniformly migrate downwind some pollutant stay within upwind state border the wind carry other to downwind states and some subset of that group drift to states without air quality problem the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth the holy bible john king james version in craft a solution to the problem of interstate air pollution regulator must account for the vagary of the wind finally upwind pollutant that find they way downwind be not leave unaltered by the journey rather as the gas emit by upwind polluter be carry downwind they be transform through various chemical process into altogether different pollutant the offend gas at issue in these case nitrogen oxide nox and sulfur dioxide often develop into ozone and fine particulate matter by the time they reach the atmosphere of downwind state see fed reg see also fed reg describe the component of ozone and downwind air quality must therefore be measure for ozone and concentration epa chore be to quantify the amount of upwind gas nox and that must be reduce to enable downwind states to keep they level of ozone and in check b over the past year congress have address interstate air pollution several time and with increase rigor in congress direct federal authority to encourage cooperative activity by the states and local government for the prevention and control of air pollution stat ed in congress make this instruction more concrete introduce feature still key to the act for the first time congress direct epa to establish national ambient air quality standard naaq for pollutant at level that will protect public health see stat as amend ed once epa settle on a naaqs the act require the agency to designate nonattainment area location where the concentration of a regulate pollutant exceed the naaqs d the act then shift the burden to states to propose plan adequate for compliance with the naaqs each state must submit a state implementation plan or sip to epa within three year of any new or revise naaqs a if epa determine that a state have fail to submit a adequate sip either in whole or in part the act require the agency to promulgate a federal implementation plan or fip within two year of epa unless the state correct the deficiency before a fip be issue c the act list the matter a sip must cover among sip component the version of the act require sip to include adequate provision for intergovernmental cooperation concern interstate air pollution a e stat a e this statutory requirement with its text alter over time have come to be call the good neighbor provision in congress amend the good neighbor provision to require more than cooperation it direct states to submit sip that include provision adequate to prohibi t any stationary source within the state from emit any air pollutant in amount which will prevent attainment or maintenance of air quality standard by any other state a stat a e supp ii the amend provision thus explicitly instruct upwind state to reduce emission to account for pollution export beyond they border as then write however the provision regulate only individual source that consider alone emit enough pollution to cause nonattainment in a downwind state because it be often impossible to say that any single source or group of source be the one which actually prevent attainment downwind the version of the good neighbor provision prove ineffective see ibid note the provision inability to curb the collective emission of multiple source congress most recently amend the good neighbor provision in the statute in its current form require sip to contain adequate provision prohibit any source or other type of emission activity within the state from emit any air pollutant in amount which will contribute significantly to nonattainment in or interfere with maintenance by any other state with respect to any naaqs a d i ed the controversy before we center on epa most recent attempt to construe this provision c three time over the past two decade epa have attempt to delineate the good neighbor provision scope by identify when upwind state contribute significantly to nonattainment downwind in epa issue a rule know as the nox sip call that regulation limited nox emission in upwind state to the extent such emission contribute to nonattainment of ozone standard in downwind states see fed reg in michigan epa the circuit uphold the nox sip call specifically affirm epa use of cost to determine when a upwind state contribution be significan t within the meaning of the statute at in epa issue the clean air interstate rule or cair fed reg cair regulate both nox and emission insofar as such emission contribute to downwind nonattainment of two naaq both set in one concern the permissible annual measure of and another cap the average ozone level gauge over a period see at the circuit initially vacate cair as arbitrary and capricious see north carolina epa per curiam on rehearing the court decide to leave the rule in place while encourage epa to act with dispatch in deal with problem the court have identify see north carolina epa per curiam the rule challenge here the transport rule be epa response to the circuit north carolina decision finalize in august the transport rule curtail nox and emission of upwind state to achieve downwind attainment of three different naaq the two naaqs previously address by cair and the naaqs for level measure on a daily basis see fed reg under the transport rule epa employ a approach to determine when upwind state contribute d significantly to nonattainment at and therefore in amount that have to be eliminate at step one call the screening analysis the agency exclude as de minimis any upwind state that contribute less than one percent of the three to any downwind state receptor a location at which epa measure air quality see at if all of a upwind state contribution fall below the threshold that state would be consider not to have contribute d significantly to the nonattainment of any downwind state at states in that category be screen out and exempt from regulation under the rule the remain states be subject to a second inquiry which epa call the control analysis at this stage the agency seek to generate a allocation of emission reduction among those upwind states screen in at step one the control analysis proceed this way epa first calculate for each upwind state the quantity of emission the state could eliminate at each of several cost threshold see at cost for these purpose be measure as cost per ton of emission prevent for instance by install scrubber on powerplant smokestack epa estimate for example the amount each upwind state nox emission would fall if all pollution source within each state employ every control measure available at a cost of per ton or less see at the agency then repeat that analysis at ascend cost threshold see ibid arm with this information epa conduct complex modeling to establish the combined effect the upwind reduction project at each cost threshold would have on air quality in downwind state see at the agency then identify significant cost threshold s point in its model where a noticeable change occur in downwind air quality such as where large upwind emission reduction become available because a certain type of emission control strategy become ibid for example reduction of nox sufficient to resolve or significantly curb downwind air quality problem could be achieve epa determine at a cost threshold of per ton apply uniformly to all regulate upwind state move beyond the cost threshold epa conclude would result in only minimal additional reduction in emission at finally epa translate the cost threshold it have into amount of emission upwind states would be require to eliminate for each regulate upwind state epa create a annual emission budget these budget represent the quantity of pollution a upwind state would produce in a given year if its source implement all pollution control available at the choose cost threshold see at if epa project improvement to downwind air quality be to be realize a upwind state emission could not exceed the level this budget allocate to it subject to certain adjustment not relevant here take together the screening and control inquiry define epa understanding of which upwind emission be within the good neighbor provision ambit in short under the transport rule a upwind state contribute d significantly to downwind nonattainment to the extent its export pollution both produce one percent or more of a naaqs in at least one downwind state step one and could be eliminate as determine by epa step two see at upwind states would be oblige to eliminate all and only emission meet both of these criterion for each state regulate by the transport rule epa contemporaneously promulgate a fip allocate that state emission budget among its source see at for each of these states epa have determine that the state have fail to submit a sip adequate for compliance with the good neighbor provision these determination regard sip become final after day see b supp v and many go unchallenged epa view the sip determination as have trigger its statutory obligation to promulgate a fip within two year see c a view contest by respondent see part ii infra d a group of state and local government state respondent join by industry and labor group industry respondent petition for review of the transport rule in the court of appeals for the circuit over the dissent of judge rogers the court of appeals vacate the rule in its entirety see epa action the appeal court hold exceed the agency statutory authority in two respects by promulgate fip before give state a meaningful opportunity to adopt they own implementation plan epa have in the court view upset the caa division of responsibility between the states and the federal government in the main the court of appeals acknowledge epa fip authority be trigger at the moment the agency disapprove a sip see at thus when a state propose a sip inadequate to achieve a naaqs epa could promulgate a fip immediately after disapprove that sip see at but the court of appeals rule that a different regime apply to a state failure to meet its obligation under the good neighbor provision while a naaqs be a clear numerical target a state good neighbor obligation remain nebulous and unknown the court observe until epa calculate the state emission budget ibid without these budget the court of appeals say upwind states would be compel to take a stab in the dark at calculate they own significant contribution to interstate air pollution at the circuit read the act to avoid put state in this position epa have a implicit statutory duty the court hold to give upwind state a reasonable opportunity to allocate they emission budget among source before the agency authority to issue fip could be trigger at the circuit also hold that the agency interpretation of the good neighbor provision ignore three red line cabin ing the epa authority at first the circuit interpret the good neighbor provision to require upwind state to reduce emission in a manner proportional to they contributio n to pollution in downwind state at the transport rule however treat all regulate upwind state alike regardless of they relative contribution to the overall problem see at it require all upwind states screen in at step one to reduce emission in accord with the uniform cost threshold set during the step two control analysis impose these uniform cost threshold the court of appeals observe could force some upwind states to reduce emission by more than they fair share at accord to the court of appeals epa have also fail to ensure that the transport rule do not mandate state to reduce pollution unnecessarily the good neighbor provision the circuit note target only those emission from upwind state that contribute significantly to nonattainment of a naaqs in downwind states at pollution reduction beyond that goal be unnecessary outside the purview of the agency statutory mandate ibid because the emission budget be calculate by reference to cost alone the court conclude that epa have do nothing to guard against or even measure the potentially impose by the transport rule see ibid finally by decide at the screening analysis that upwind contribution below the threshold be insignificant epa have establish a floor on the agency authority to act see at and again point to the rule reliance on cost the court of appeals hold that epa have fail to ensure that upwind state be not be force to reduce emission below the threshold see ibid in dissent judge rogers criticize the majority for decide two question that be not in she view properly before the court see at first she address the majority insistence that fip abide a state opportunity to allocate its emission budget among source she regard the respondent plea to that effect as a untimely attack on epa previous sip disapproval see at second in judge rogers assessment the respondent have fail to raise they substantive objection to the transport rule with the specificity necessary to preserve they for review see at on the merit judge rogers find nothing in the act to require or even suggest that epa must quantify a state good neighbor obligation before it promulgate a fip see at she also disagree with the court conclusion that the transport rule unreasonably interpret the act see at we grant certiorari to decide whether the circuit have accurately construe the limit the caa place on epa authority see ii a once epa have calculate emission budget the circuit hold the agency must give upwind states the opportunity to propose sip allocate those budget among source before issue a fip at as the state respondent put it a fip allocate a state emission budget must issue after epa have quantify the states obligation in a emission budget and give the states a reasonable opportunity to meet those obligation in sip brief for state respondents before reach the merit of this argument we first reject epa threshold objection that the claim be untimely accord to the agency this argument and the circuit opinion accept it rank as improper collateral attack on epa prior sip disapproval as earlier recount see supra at epa by the time it issue the transport rule have determine that each regulate upwind state have fail to submit a sip adequate to satisfy the good neighbor provision many of those determination because unchallenged become final after day see b and do so before the petition here at issue be file epa argue that the court can not question exercise of the agency fip authority without subject these final sip disapproval to untimely review we disagree the gravamen of the state respondent challenge be not that epa disapproval of any particular sip be erroneous rather respondent urge that notwithstanding these disapproval the agency be oblige to grant a upwind state a second opportunity to adequate sip once epa set the state emission budget this claim do not depend on the validity of the prior sip disapproval even assume the legitimacy of those disapproval the question remain whether epa be require to do more than disapprove a sip as the state respondent urge to trigger the agency statutory authority to issue a fip b turn to the merit we hold that the text of the statute support epa position as earlier note see supra at the caa set a series of precise deadline to which the states and epa must adhere once epa issue any new or revise naaqs a state have three year to adopt a sip adequate for compliance with the act requirement see a among those requirement be the act mandate that sip shall include provision sufficient to satisfy the good neighbor provision a if epa determine a sip to be inadequate the agency mandate to replace it with a fip be no less absolute epa shall promulgate a fip at any time within year after the agency a find that a state have fail to make a require submission or find that the plan or plan revision submit by the state do not satisfy the minimum relevant criterion or b disapprove a sip in whole or in part unless the state correct the deficiency and epa approve the plan or plan revision before the agency promulgate such fip c in other word once epa have find a sip inadequate the agency have a statutory duty to issue a fip at any time within two year unless the state first correct the deficiency which no one contend occur here the circuit however find a unwritten exception to this strict time prescription for sip aim at implement the good neighbor provision expect any one state to develop a comprehensive solution to the collective problem of interstate air pollution without first receive epa guidance be in the court of appeals assessment set ting the states up to fail at the circuit therefore require epa after promulgate each state emission budget to give the state a reasonable period of time to propose sip implement its budget see at however sensible or not the court of appeals position a review court task be to apply the text of the statute not to improve upon it pavelic leflore marvel entertainment group div of cadence industries nothing in the act the good neighbor provision from the several other matter a state must address in its sip rather the statute speak without reservation once a naaqs have be issue a state shall propose a sip within three year a and that sip shall include among other component provision adequate to satisfy the good neighbor provision a nor do the act condition the duty to promulgate a fip on epa have first quantify a upwind state good neighbor obligation as judge rogers observe in she dissent from the circuit decision the act do not require epa to furnish upwind state with information of any kind about they good neighbor obligation before a fip issue see at instead a sip failure to satisfy the good neighbor provision without more trigger epa obligation to issue a federal plan within two year c after epa have disapprove a sip the agency can wait up to two year to issue a fip during which time the state can correc t the deficiency on its own ibid but epa be not oblige to wait two year or postpone its action even a single day the act empower the agency to promulgate a fip at any time within the limit ibid carve out a exception to the act precise deadline as the circuit do rewrite a statute whose plain text and structure establish a clear chronology of federal and state responsibility at rogers dissent the practical difficulty cite by the court of appeals do not justify departure from the act plain text see barnhart sigmon coal we must presume that a legislature say in a statute what it mean and mean in a statute what it say there internal quotation mark omit when congress elect to make epa input a prerequisite to state action under the act it do so expressly states develop vehicle inspection and maintenance program under the caa for example must await epa guidance before issue sip c b a state obligation to adopt a sip moreover arise only after epa have first set the naaqs the state must meet a have congress intend similarly to defer states discharge of they obligation under the good neighbor provision congress we take it would have include a similar direction in that section see jama immigration and customs enforcement we do not lightly assume that congress have omit from its adopt text requirement that it nonetheless intend to apply and we reluctance be even greater when congress have show elsewhere in the same statute that it know how to make such a requirement manifest in short nothing in the statute place epa under a obligation to provide specific metric to states before they undertake to fulfill they good neighbor obligation by alter the schedule congress provide for sip and fip the circuit stretch out the process it allow a delay congress do not order and place a information submission obligation on epa congress do not impose the circuit we hold have no warrant thus to revise the caa prescription c at oral argument the state respondent emphasize epa previous decision in the nox sip call and cair to quantify the emission reduction require of upwind state before the window to propose a sip close see tr of oral arg in they view by fail to accord states a similar grace period after issue state emission budget epa act arbitrarily see ibid whatever pattern the agency follow in its nox sip call and cair proceedings epa retain discretion to alter its course provide it give a reasonable explanation for do so motor vehicle mfrs of united states state farm mut automobile ins the agency present such a explanation in the transport rule as note see supra at the circuit north carolina decision admonish epa to act with dispatch in amend or replace cair the transport rule predecessor see at warning epa that the stay of the court decision to vacate cair would not persist indefinite ly give north carolina stress on expeditious action to cure the infirmity the court identify in cair epa think it in appropriate to establish the lengthy transition period entail in allow states time to propose new or amend sip implement the transport rule emission budget see fed reg cite north carolina endeavor to satisfy the circuit directive epa act speedily issue fip contemporaneously with the transport rule in light of the firm deadline impose by the act which we hold the circuit lack authority to alter we can not condemn epa decision as arbitrary or capricious iii a the circuit also hold that the transport rule interpretation of the good neighbor provision conflict with the act before address this holding we take up a jurisdictional objection raise by epa the caa direct that o nly a objection to a rule raise with reasonable specificity during the period for public comment may be raise during judicial review d b respondent fail to state they objection to the transport rule during the comment period with the specificity require for preservation epa argue see brief for federal petitioners this failure at the administrative level epa urge foreclose judicial review at assume without decide that respondent do not meet the act reasonable specificity requirement during the comment period we do not regard that lapse as jurisdictional this court have caution against profligate use of the label jurisdictional sebelius auburn regional medical center slip at a rule may be mandatory yet not jurisdictional we have explain see arbaugh y h section d b we hold be of that character it do not speak to a court authority but only to a party procedural obligation see kontrick ryan have epa pursue the reasonable specificity argument vigorously before the circuit we would be obligate to address the merit of the argument see gonzalez thaler slip at but epa do not press the argument unequivocally before the circuit it indicate only that the reasonable specificity prescription might bar judicial review brief for respondent epa et in cadc see also at we therefore do not count the prescription a impassable hindrance to we adjudication of the respondent attack on epa interpretation of the transport rule we turn to that attack mindful of the importance of the issue respondent raise to the ongoing implementation of the good neighbor provision b we routinely accord dispositive effect to a agency reasonable interpretation of ambiguous statutory language chevron natural resources defense council be the pathmarking decision and it bear a notable resemblance to the case before we chevron concerned epa definition of the term source as use in the amendment to the caa at those amendment place additional restriction on company liberty to add new pollution source to they factory see at although source might have be interpret to refer to a individual smokestack epa construe the term to refer to a entire plant thereby treat ing all of the device within the plant as though they be encase within a single bubble ibid under the agency interpretation a new device would not subject a plant to the additional restriction if the alteration do not increase the total emission produce by the plant ibid this court hold epa interpretation of source a reasonable construction of a ambiguous statutory term when congress have not directly address the precise interpretative question at issue we caution a review court can not simply impose its own construction o f the statute at rather the agency be charge with fill the gap leave open by the ambiguity at because a full understanding of the force of the statutory policy depend s upon more than ordinary knowledge of the situation the administer agency construction be to be accord control weight unless arbitrary capricious or manifestly contrary to the statute at quote united states shimer determine that none of those term fit epa interpretation of source the court defer to the agency judgment we conclude that the good neighbor provision delegate authority to epa at least as certainly as the caa provision involve in chevron the statute require states to eliminate those amount of pollution that contribute significantly to nonattainment in downwind states a d i emphasis add thus epa be to reduce upwind pollution but only in amount that push a downwind state pollution concentration above the relevant naaqs as note earlier however the nonattainment of downwind states result from the collective and interwoven contribution of multiple upwind state see supra at the statute therefore call upon the agency to address a thorny causation problem how should epa allocate among multiple contribute upwind states responsibility for a downwind state excess pollution a simplify example illustrate the puzzle epa face suppose the agency set a naaqs with respect to a particular pollutant at part per billion ppb and that the level of the pollutant in the atmosphere of downwind state a be ppb suppose further that epa have determine that each of three upwind state x y and z contribute the equivalent of ppb of the relevant pollutant to state a airspace the good neighbor provision as just observe prohibit only upwind emission that contribute significantly to downwind nonattainment epa authority under the provision be therefore limit to eliminate a total of ppb the overage cause by the collective contribution of states x y and how be epa to divide responsibility among the three states should the agency allocate reduction proportionally ppb each on a per capita basis on the basis of the cost of abatement or by some other metric see brief for federal petitioners note epa consideration of different approach the good neighbor provision do not answer that question for epa chevron at t he language of the caa simply do not compel any give interpretation of the term source under chevron we read congress silence as a delegation of authority to epa to select from among reasonable option see united states mead yet the court of appeals believe that the act speak clearly require epa to allocate responsibility for reduce emission in a manner proportional to each state contributio n to the problem at nothing in the text of the good neighbor provision propel epa down this path understandably so for as epa note the circuit proportionality approach could scarcely be satisfy in practice see app in cadc w hile it be possible to determine a emission reduction percentage if there be a single downwind receptor most upwind state contribute to multiple downwind receptor in multiple state and would have a different reduction percentage for each one to illustrate consider a variation on the example set out above imagine that states x and y now contribute air pollution to state a in a ratio of one to five state y contribute five time the amount of pollution to state a than do state x if state a be the only downwind state to which the two upwind states contribute the circuit proportionality requirement would be easy to meet epa could require state y to reduce its emission by five time the amount demand of state the reality of interstate air pollution however be not so simple most upwind states contribute pollution to multiple downwind state in vary amount see fed reg see also brief for respondent calpine et in support of petitioners offering example suppose then that states x and y also contribute pollutant to a second downwind state state b this time in a ratio of seven to one though state y contribute a relatively larger share of pollution to state a with respect to state b state x be the greater offender follow the proportionality approach with respect to state b would demand that state x reduce its emission by seven time as much as state recall however that state y as just hypothesize have to effect five time as large a reduction with respect to state a the court of appeals proportionality edict with respect to both state a and state b appear to work neither mathematically nor in practical application proportionality as to one state will not achieve proportionality as to other quite the opposite and where as be generally true upwind states contribute pollution to more than two downwind receptor proportionality become all the more elusive neither the circuit nor respondent face up to this problem the dissent for its part strain to give mean to the circuit proportionality constraint as apply to a world in which multiple upwind states contribute emission to multiple downwind location in the dissent view upwind state must eliminate emission by whatever minimum amount reduce they share of the overage in each and every one of the downwind states to which they be link see post at in practical term this mean each upwind state will be require to reduce emission by the amount necessary to eliminate that state largest downwind contribution the dissent formulation however do not account for the combined and cumulative effect of each upwind state reduction on attainment in multiple downwind location see ibid under a approach state x would be require to eliminate emission of that pollutant by whatever minimum amount reduce both state a level by unit and state b by unit emphasis add the result would be costly overregulation unnecessary to indeed in conflict with the good neighbor provision goal of attainment in response the dissent assert that epa will simply be require to make allowance for the overregulation cause by its approach post at what criterion should epa employ to determine which states will have to make those allowance s and by how much the dissent admit there be multiple way epa might answer those question ibid but proportionality can not be one of those way for the approach be what lead to the overregulation in the first place and if a nonproportional approach can play a role in set the final allocation of reduction obligation then it be hardly apparent why epa free to depart from proportionality at the back end can not do so at the outset persuade that the good neighbor provision do not dictate the particular allocation of emission among contribute states advance by the circuit we must next decide whether the allocation method choose by epa be a permissible construction of the statute chevron at as epa interpret the statute upwind emission rank as amount that contribute significantly to nonattainment if they constitute one percent or more of a relevant naaqs in a nonattaining downwind state and can be eliminate under the cost threshold set by the agency see fed reg in other word to identify which emission be to be eliminate epa consider both the magnitude of upwind state contribution and the cost associate with eliminate they the industry respondent argue that however epa ultimately divide responsibility among upwind states the final calculation can not rely on cost the good neighbor provision respondent and the dissent emphasize require each state to prohibit only those amount of air pollution emit within the state that contribute significantly to another state nonattaintment brief for industry respondent emphasis add see also post at the cost of prevent emission they urge be wholly unrelated to the actual amoun t of air pollution a upwind state contribute brief for industry respondent because the transport rule consider cost respondent argue state that contribute identical amount may be deem by epa to have make substantially different contribution at but as just explain see supra at the agency can not avoid the task of choose which among equal amount to eliminate the agency have choose sensibly in we view to reduce the amount easier less costly to eradicate and nothing in the text of the good neighbor provision preclude that choice use cost in the transport rule calculus we agree with epa also make good sense eliminate those amount that can be reduce be a efficient and equitable solution to the allocation problem the good neighbor provision require the agency to address efficient because epa can achieve the level of attainment of emission reduction the proportional approach aim to achieve but at a much lower overall cost because by impose uniform cost threshold on regulated states epa rule subject to stricter regulation those states that have do relatively less in the past to control they pollution upwind states that have not yet implement pollution control of the same stringency as they neighbor will be stop from free ride on they neighbor effort to reduce pollution they will have to bring down they emission by install device of the kind in which neighboring states have already invest suppose for example that the industry of upwind state a have expend considerable resource install modern device on they plant factory in upwind state b by contrast continue to run old dirty plant yet perhaps because state a be more populous and therefore generate a larger sum of pollution overall the two states emission have equal effect on downwind attainment if state a and state b be require to eliminate emission proportionally equally source in state a will be compel to spend far more per ton of reduction because they have already utilize lower cost pollution control state a source will also have to achieve greater reduction than would have be require have they not make the reduction in the first place state a in other word will be toll for have do more to reduce pollution in the past epa allocation avoid these anomaly obligate to require the elimination of only those amount of pollutant that contribute to the nonattainment of naaqs in downwind states epa must decide how to differentiate among the otherwise like contribution of multiple upwind state epa find decisive the difficulty of eliminate each amount the cost incur in do so lack a dispositive statutory instruction to guide it epa decision we conclude be a reasonable way of fill the gap leave open by congress chevron at c the circuit state two further objection to epa method of define a upwind state contribution once a state be screen in at step one of epa analysis its emission budget be calculate solely with reference to the uniform cost threshold the agency select at step two the transport rule thus leave open the possibility that a state might be compel to reduce emission beyond the point at which every affect downwind state be in attainment a phenomenon the court of appeals term at see supra at second epa focus on cost do not foreclose as the circuit accurately observe the possibility that a upwind state would be require to reduce its emission by so much that the state no longer contribute one or more of a relevant naaqs to any downwind state this would place the state below the mark epa have set during the screening phase as the initial threshold of significan ce see at and we agree with the court of appeals to this extent epa can not require a state to reduce its output of pollution by more than be necessary to achieve attainment in every downwind state or at odds with the threshold the agency have set if epa require a upwind state to reduce emission by more than the amount necessary to achieve attainment in every downwind state to which it be link the agency will have overstep its authority under the good neighbor provision to eliminate those amount that contribute to nonattainment nor can epa demand reduction that would drive a upwind state contribution to every downwind state to which it be link below one percent of the relevant naaqs do so would be counter to step one of the agency interpretation of the good neighbor provision see fed reg s tate whose contribution be below th e threshold do not significantly contribute to nonattainment of the relevant naaqs neither possibility however justify wholesale invalidation of the transport rule first instance of in particular downwind location the circuit acknowledge see at may be incidental to reduction necessary to ensure attainment elsewhere because individual upwind state often contribute significantly to nonattainment in multiple downwind location the emission reduction require to bring one link downwind state into attainment may well be large enough to push other link downwind states over the attainment line as the good neighbor provision seek attainment in every downwind state however exceed attainment in one state can not rank as unless unnecessary to achieve attainment in any downwind state only reduction unnecessary to downwind attainment anywhere fall outside the agency statutory authority second while epa have a statutory duty to avoid the agency also have a statutory obligation to avoid to maximize achievement of attainment downwind for reason earlier explain see supra at a degree of imprecision be inevitable in tackle the problem of interstate air pollution slight change in wind pattern or energy consumption for example may vary downwind air quality in way epa might not have anticipate the good neighbor provision require epa to seek downwind attainment of naaqs notwithstanding the uncertainty hence some amount of emission budget that turn out to be more demand than necessary would not be surprising require to balance the possibility of and epa must have leeway in fulfil its statutory mandate finally in a voluminous record involve thousand of linkage respondent point to only a few instance of unnecessary emission reduction and even those be contest by epa compare brief for industry respondent with reply brief for federal petitioners epa for its part offer datum contest by respondent purport to show that few if any upwind state have be require to limit emission below the threshold of significance compare brief for federal petitioners with brief for industry respondent if any upwind state conclude it have be force to regulate emission below the threshold or beyond the point necessary to bring all downwind states into attainment that state may bring a particularized challenge to the transport rule along with any other challenge it may have babbitt sweet home chapter communities for great approve agency reasonable interpretation of statute despite possibility of improper application american hospital nlrb reject facial challenge to national labor relations board rule despite possible arbitrary application satisfy that epa methodology on its face be not arbitrary capricious or manifestly contrary to the statute chevron at we uphold the transport rule the possibility that the rule in uncommon particular application might exceed epa statutory authority do not warrant judicial condemnation of the rule in its entirety in sum we hold that the caa do not command that states be give a second opportunity to file a sip after epa have quantify the state interstate pollution obligation we further conclude that the good neighbor provision do not require epa to disregard cost and consider exclusively each upwind state physically proportionate responsibility for each downwind air quality problem epa allocation of emission reduction among upwind states we hold be a permissible workable and equitable interpretation of the good neighbor provision for the reason state the judgment of the united states court of appeals for the circuit be reverse and the case be remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion it be so order justice alito take no part in the consideration or decision of these case scalia dissent and et et and et et on writ of certiorari to the united state court of appeal for the district of columbia circuit april justice scalia with whom justice thomas join dissent too many important decision of the federal government be make nowadays by unelected agency official exercise broad lawmaking authority rather than by the people representative in congress with the statute involve in the present case however congress do it right it specify quite precisely the responsibility of a upwind state under the good neighbor provision to eliminate those amount of pollutant that it contribute to downwind problem area but the environmental protection agency be unsatisfied with this system agency personnel perhaps correctly think it more efficient to require reduction not in proportion to the amount of pollutant for which each upwind state be responsible but on the basis of how each can decrease emission today the majority approve that undemocratic revision of the clean air act the agency come forward with a textual justification for its action rely on a farfetched meaning of the word significantly in the statutory text that justification be so feeble that today majority do not even recite it much less defend it the majority reach its result look ma no hand without benefit of text claim to have identify a remarkable gap in the statute which it proceed to fill contrary to the plain logic of the statute with analysis and then with no pretended textual justification at all simply extend analysis beyond the scope of the alleged gap additionally the majority relieve epa of any obligation to announce novel interpretation of the good neighbor provision before the states must submit plan that be require to comply with those interpretation by accord the states primacy in decide how to attain the govern standard the clean air act be pregnant with a obligation for the agency to set those standard before the states can be expect to achieve they the majority nonetheless approve epa promulgation of federal plan implement benchmark before the states could conceivably have meet those benchmark on they own i would affirm the judgment of the circuit that epa violate the law both in craft the transport rule and in implement it i the transport rule it be axiomatic that a administrative agency power to promulgate legislative regulation be limit to the authority delegate by congress bowen georgetown hospital yet today the majority treat the text of the clean air act not as the source and ceiling of epa authority to regulate interstate air pollution but rather as a difficulty to be overcome in pursuit of the agency responsibility to craf t a solution to the problem of interstate air pollution ante at in reality congress itself have craft the solution the good neighbor provision require each state to eliminate whatever amount of air pollutant s contribute significantly to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance of national ambient standard naaq in other states a d i i the statute address solely the environmental consequence of emission not the facility of reduce they and it require states to shoulder burden in proportion to the size of they contribution not in proportion to the ease of bear they epa utterly fanciful from each accord to its ability construction sacrifice democratically adopt text to bureaucratically favored policy it deserve no deference under chevron natural resources defense council alleged textual support significantly in the government argument here the assert textual support for the approach adopt by epa in the transport rule be the ambiguity of the word significantly in the statutory requirement that each state eliminate those amount of pollutant that contribute significantly to nonattainment in downwind states a d i i emphasis add as describe in the government briefing t he term significantly be ambiguous and epa may permissibly determine the amount of a state significant contribution by reference to the amount of emission reduction achievable through application of highly control reply brief for federal petitioners emphasis add some internal quotation mark omit and as the government state at oral argument i n term of the language contribute significantly epa reasonably construe that term to include a component of difficulty of achievement cost that be in common parlance we might say that dunk a basketball be a more significant achievement for somebody who be foot than for somebody who be foot tr of oral arg emphasis add but of course the statute do not focus on whether the upwind state have achieve significantly it ask whether the state have contribute significantly to downwind pollution the provision address the physical effect of physical cause and it be only the magnitude of the relationship sufficient to trigger regulation that admit of some vagueness state differently the statute be ambiguous as to how much of a contribution to downwind pollution be significant but it be not at all ambiguous as to whether factor unrelated to the amount of pollutant that make up a contribution affect the analysis just as i t do not matter whether the word yellow be ambiguous when the agency have interpret it to mean purple united states home concrete supply llc scalia concur in part and concur in judgment slip at it do not matter whether the phrase amount which contribute significantly to downwind naaqs nonattainment be ambiguous when epa have interpret it to mean amount which be inexpensive to eliminate it would be extraordinary for congress by use of the single word significantly to transmogrify a statute that assign responsibility on the basis of amount of pollutant emit into a statute authorize epa to reduce interstate pollution in the manner that it believe most efficient we have repeatedly say that congress do not alter the fundamental detail of a regulatory scheme in vague term or ancillary provision it do not one might say hide elephant in mousehole whitman american trucking cite mci telecommunications american telephone telegraph fda brown williamson tobacco the statute history demonstrate that significantly be not code for feel free to consider compliance cost the previous version of the good neighbor provision require each state to prohibit emission that would prevent attainment or maintenance by any other state of any naaqs stat emphasis add it be evident that the current reformulation targeting any air pollutant in amount which will contribute significantly to nonattainment in or interfere with maintenance by any other state with respect to any naaqs be mean simply to eliminate any implication that the pollute state have to be a rather than merely a contribute cause of the downwind nonattainment or maintenance problem not to allow cost concern to creep in through the back door in another respect also epa reliance upon the word significantly be plainly mistaken the good neighbor provision target for elimination not only those emission that contribute significantly to nonattainment of naaqs in any other state but also those that interfere with maintenance of naaqs by any other state a d i i the significantly be absent from the latter phrase epa do provide any textual justification for the conclusion that when the same amount of a pollutant travel downwind from states x and y to a single area in state a the emission from x but not y can be say to interfere with maintenance of the naaqs in a just because they be cheaper to eliminate yet epa propose to use the from each accord to its ability approach for nonattainment area and maintenance area to its credit the majority do not allude to much less try to defend the government significantly argument but there be a serious downside to this the of significantly be call into service to counter the criterion of responsibility plainly provide in the statute text amount of pollutant contribute to downwind problem area see brief for federal petitioners have forswear reliance on significantly to convert responsibility for amount of pollutant into responsibility for easy reduction of pollutant the majority be impale upon the statutory text b the alleged gap to fill the void create by its abandonment of epa significantly argument the majority identify a gap in the text which epa must fill while the text say that each upwind state must be responsible for its own contribution to downwind pollution it do not say how responsibility be to be divide among multiple states when the total of they combined contribution to downwind pollution in a particular area exceed the reduction that the relevant naaqs require in the example give by the majority ante at when each of three upwind states contribute unit of a pollutant to a downwind state but the reduction require for that state to comply with the naaqs be only unit how will responsibility for that unit be apportion wow that be a hard one almost the equivalent of ask who be bury in grant tomb if the criterion of responsibility be amount of pollutant then surely share responsibility must be base upon relative amount of pollutant in the majority example unit for each state the statute make no sense otherwise the good neighbor provision contain a gap only for those who blind themselves to the obvious in order to pursue a preferred policy but not only do the majority bring in analysis to fill a gap that do not really exist have fill that gap it then extend the principle to situation beyond the imaginary gap that be situation where no apportionment be require even where a upwind state contribute pollutant to only a single downwind state its annual emission budget will be base not upon the amount of pollutant it contribute but upon what pollution control be available at the choose cost threshold ante at epa justification be its implausible and only notion that significantly import cost concern into the provision the majority have abandon that absurdity be leave to deal with the situation with no defense not even a imaginary gap against a statutory text c the majority criticism of proportional reduction impossibility the majority contend that a approach could scarcely be satisfy in practice and appear to work neither mathematically nor in practical application ante at in essence that the approach be impossible of application if that be true i know of no legal authority and no democratic principle that would derive from it the consequence that epa could rewrite the statute rather than the consequence that the statute would be inoperative there be sometimes statute which no rule or canon of interpretation can make effective or applicable to the situation of fact which they purport to govern in such case the statute must simply fail pound jurisprudence footnote omit in other word the impossibility argument have no independent force it be relevant only if the majority textual interpretation be permissible but in any event the argument be wrong the impossibility theorem rest upon the follow scenario imagine that states x and y contribute air pollution to state a in a ratio of one to five ante at and suppose that states x and y also contribute pollutant to a second downwind state state b this time in a ratio of seven to one ibid the majority conclude that t he court of appeals proportionality edict with respect to both state a and state b appear to work neither mathematically nor in practical application ibid but why not the majority model rely on two faulty premise one a oversimplification and the other a misapprehension first the majority formulation suggest that epa measure the comparative downwind drift of pollutant in proportion between states in reality however epa assess quantity in physical unit not proportion so the majority illustration of a ratio describe the relative contribution of states x and y to state a pollution might mean for example that x be responsible for unit of some pollutant above the naaqs in a and that y be responsible for unit and the second example assume a ratio underlie state x and y contribution to state b pollution might mean that state x supplies unit of the same pollutant above the naaqs and state y unit under a approach state x would be require to eliminate emission of that pollutant by whatever minimum amount reduce both state a level by unit and state b by unit state y in turn would be require to curtail its emission by whatever minimum amount decrease both state a measure by unit and state b by unit but the majority object the reduction that state x must make to help bring state b into compliance may be more than those necessary for it to help bring state a into compliance result in of x with respect to see ante at and this objection disclose the second flaw in the impossibility theorem echo epa see brief for federal petitioners the majority believe that the circuit interpretation of the good neighbor provision forbid with respect to even a single downwind receptor that be the only way in which the approach could be deem to work neither mathematically nor in practical application on its face ante at but the premise be incorrect although some of the circuit simplify example might support that conclusion its opinion explicitly acknowledge that the complexity of condition demand the contrary to be sure there may be some truly unavoidable in some downwind states that occur as a byproduct of the necessity of reduce upwind state emission enough to meet the naaqs in other downwind state moreover the majority itself recognize that the good neighbor provision do not categorically prohibit as the good neighbor provision seek attainment in every downwind state exceed attainment in one state can not rank as unless unnecessary to achieve attainment in any downwind state ante at the majority apparently fail to appreciate that have clear up that potential point of confusion nothing stand in the way of the approach the majority rely on a epa document precede the transport rule to establish the agency suppose belief that the approach could scarcely be satisfy in practice ante at but the document say no such thing rather it show that the agency reject a air methodology not because it be impossible of application but it fail to account for cost see app in cadc the document label as a technical difficulty not a impossibility the fact that most upwind state contribute to multiple downwind receptor in multiple state and would have a different reduction percentage for each one at the clean air act be full of technical difficulty and this one be overcome by require each state to make the greatest reduction necessary with respect to any downwind area apparently concede that the approach may not be impossible of application after all the majority alternatively assert that it would cause costly overregulation unnecessary to indeed in conflict with the good neighbor provision goal of attainment ante at this assertion of massive overregulation assume that a vast number of downwind state will be the accidental beneficiary of collateral pollution reduction that be nontargeted reduction that occur as a consequence of require reduction target at neighbor downwind states collateral pollution reduction be the opposite of collateral damage so to speak the majority contend that the collateral pollution reduction enjoy by a downwind state will cause the require upwind reduction actually target that state to exceed the level necessary to assure attainment or maintenance thus produce unnecessary i have no reason to believe that the problem of be as extensive and thus costly as the majority allege and the majority provide none but never mind that it suffice to say that be no more likely to occur when the require reduction be apportion among upwind state on the basis of amount of pollutant contribute than when they be apportion on the basis of cost there be no conceivable reason why the state that bear the brunt of the majority and epa approach be less likely to be than the states that would bear the brunt of my and the statute approach indeed epa never attempt to establish that the transport rule do not produce gross see at what cause the problem of be not the manner of apportion the require reduction but the composite volume of the require reduction in each downwind state if the majority approach reduce it admittedly do not entirely eliminate it that be only because epa apply its principle not just to determine the proportion of require reduction that each upwind state must bear but to determine the volume of those require reduction see supra at in any case the solution to under a system be not difficult to discern in calculate responsibility epa would simply be require to make allowance for what i have call collateral pollution reduction the agency would set upwind states obligation at level that after take into account those reduction suffice to produce attainment in all downwind states doubtless there be multiple way for the agency to accomplish that task in accordance with the statute proportional focus the majority itself invoke a unexplained device to prevent in uncommon particular application of its scheme ante at whatever that device be it can serve just as well to prevent under the approach i have outline i fully acknowledge that the approach will demand some complicated computation where one upwind state be link to multiple downwind state and vice versa i be confident however that epa skilled can adhere to the statute quantitative rather than efficiency mandate by craft quantitative solution indeed those calculation can be perform at the desk whereas the from each accord to its ability approach require the unwieldy field examination of many source with many sort of equipment plus ça change epa continuing quest for authority the majority agree with epa assessment that u sing cost in the transport rule calculus make good sense ante at its opinion declare that e liminate those amount that can be reduce be a efficient and equitable solution to the allocation problem the good neighbor provision require the agency to address ibid efficient probably equitable perhaps so but perhaps not see brief for industry respondent but the point be that whether efficiency should have a dominant or subordinate role be not for epa or this court to determine this be not the first time epa have seek to convert the clean air act into a mandate for regulation whitman american trucking confront epa contention that it could consider cost in set naaqs the provision at issue there like this one do not expressly bar decisionmaking and unlike this one it even contain word that be arguably ambiguous in the relevant respect specifically b instruct epa to set primary naaqs the attainment and maintenance of which be requisite to protect the public health with a adequate margin of safety one could hardly overstate the capaciousness of the word adequate and the phrase public health be at least equally susceptible indeed much more susceptible of permit analysis as the word significantly be here as the respondent in american trucking argue set naaq without consider cost may bring about fail industry and fewer job which in turn may produce poorer and less healthy citizen see at but we conclude that in the context of the entire provision that interpretation ma de no sense ibid as quote earlier we say that congress do not alter the fundamental detail of a regulatory scheme in vague term or ancillary provision it do not hide elephant in mousehole at in american trucking the court refuse to find implicit in ambiguous section of the clear air act a authorization to consider cost that have elsewhere and so often be expressly grant at cite a tradition date back to union epa and there be indeed numerous clean air act provision explicitly permit cost to be take into account see a a c a b b f a american trucking thus demand a textual commitment of authority to the epa to consider cost at a hurdle that the good neighbor provision come nowhere close to clearing today opinion turn its back upon that case and be incompatible with that opinion ii imposition of federal implementation plan the circuit vacate the transport rule for the additional reason that epa take the rein in allocate emission budget among source through federal implementation plans fip without first provide the states a meaningful opportunity to perform that task through state implementation plan sip the majority reject that ruling on the ground that the act do not require epa to furnish upwind state with information of any kind about they good neighbor obligation before a fip issue ante at n othing in the statute the majority say place epa under a obligation to provide specific metric to states before they undertake to fulfill they good neighbor obligation ante at this remarkably expansive reasoning make a hash of the clean air act transform it from a program base on cooperative federalism to one of centralized federal control nothing in the good neighbor provision suggest such a stark departure from the act fundamental structure implication of state regulatory primacy down to its very core the clean air act set forth a regulatory strategy the act begin by declare that air pollution prevention that be the reduction or elimination through any measure of the amount of pollutant produce or create at the source and air pollution control at its source be the primary responsibility of states and local government a emphasis add state primacy permeate title i which address the promulgation and implementation of naaqs in particular under a epa must promulgate naaqs for each pollutant for which criterion have be issue pursuant to section a in turn require each state usually within three year of each new or revise naaqs to submit a sip provide for its implementation maintenance and enforcement epa may step in to take over that responsibility if and only if a state discharge it inadequately specifically if the agency find that a state have fail to make a require or complete submission or disapprove a sip it shall promulgate a fip at any time within year unless the state correct the deficiency and epa approve the sip or sip revision c to describe the effect of this statutory scheme in simple term after epa set numerical benchmark congress plainly leave with the states the power to determine which source would be burden by regulation and to what extent union at the states be to present they choose means of achieve epa benchmark in sip and only if a sip fail to meet those goal may the agency commandeer a state authority by promulgate a fip s o long as the ultimate effect of a state choice of emission limitation be compliance with the naaqs the state be at liberty to adopt whatever mix of emission limitation it deem best suit to its particular situation train natural resources defense council epa we have emphasize be relegate by the act to a secondary role in the process of determine and enforce the specific emission limitation which be necessary if the naaqs be to be meet ibid the good neighbor provision be one of the requirement with which sip must comply a d i i the statutory structure describe above plainly demand that epa afford states a meaningful opportunity to allocate reduction responsibility among the source within they border but the majority hold that epa may in effect force the states to guess at what those responsibility might be by require they to submit sip before learn what the agency regard as a significan t contribution with the consequence of lose they regulatory primacy if they guess wrong epa assert that the circuit be wrong as a factual matter in reasoning that states can not feasibly implement the good neighbor provision without know what the agency consider they obligation to be brief for federal petitioners that be literally unbelievable the only support that epa can muster be the assertion that states routinely undertake technically complex air quality determination and that emission information from all states be publicly available ibid as respondent rightly state all the scientific knowledge in the world be useless if the states be leave to guess the way in which epa might ultimately quantify significan ce brief for state respondents call it punish ing the states for fail to meet a standard that epa have not yet announce and they do not yet know at ask they to hit the target before epa define it at require they to take a stab in the dark at or set ting the states up to fail at call it hide ing the ball brief for state respondents or a shell game at call it pin the tail on the donkey tr of oral arg as we have recently explain it be one thing to expect regulated party to conform they conduct to a agency interpretation once the agency announce they it be quite another to require regulated party to divine the agency interpretation in advance or else be hold liable when the agency announce its interpretation for the first time and demand deference christopher smithkline beecham slip at that principle apply a fortiori to a regulatory regime that rest on principle of cooperative federalism past epa practice epa itself have long acknowledge the proposition that it be nonsensical to expect states to comply with the good neighbor provision absent direction about what constitute a significan t contribution to interstate pollution the agency consistently adopt that position prior to the transport rule in when it issue the nox sip call under k epa acknowledge that w ithout determine a acceptable level of nox reduction the upwind state would not have guidance as to what be a acceptable submission fed reg epa deem it most efficient indeed necessary for the federal government to establish the overall emission level for the various states ibid accordingly the agency quantify responsibility and then allow states a year to submit sip to implement they at similarly when epa issue the clean air interstate rule cair in under c it explicitly recognize d that states would face great difficulty in develop transport sip to meet the requirement of today action without th e datum and policy provide by the rule include judgment from epa concern the appropriate criterion for determine whether upwind source contribute significantly to downwind nonattainment under a d at the agency thus give the states month to submit sip implement they new responsibility see at although epa publish fip before that window close it specify that they be mean to serve only as a federal backstop and would not become effective unless necessary a year after the cair sip submission deadline at even since promulgate the transport rule epa have repeatedly reaffirm that states can not be expect to read the agency mind in other proceedings epa have time and again state that although s ome of the element of the process be relatively straightforward other clearly require interpretation by epa through rulemaking or recommendation through guidance in order to give specific mean for a particular naaqs at as a example of the latter the agency have remark that the good neighbor provision contain numerous term that require substantial rulemaking by epa in order to determine such basic point as what constitute significant contribution cite cair in fact epa repeat those precise statement not once not twice but time follow promulgation of the transport rule notwithstanding what party may have argue in other litigation many year ago it be beyond responsible debate that the states can not possibly design sip without know the target at which they must aim epa insist that it enjoy significant discretion indeed that it can consider essentially whatever factor it wish to determine what constitute a significan t contribution to interstate pollution and it simultaneously assert that the states ought to know what quantity it will choose the agency and the majority can not have it both way abuse of discretion the majority attempt to place the blame for hollow out the core of the clean air act on the act plain text ante at the first textual element to which it refer be c requirement that after epa have disapprove a sip it shall promulgate a fip at any time within year that be to say the agency have discretion whether to act at once or to defer action until some later point during the period but it also have discretion to work within the prescribe timetable to respect the rightful role of states in the statutory scheme by delay the issuance or enforcement of fip pend the resubmission and approval of sip as epa conduct surround cair clearly demonstrate and all of this assume that the agency insist on disapprove sip before promulgate the applicable standard though in fact epa have discretion to publicize those metric before the window to submit sip close in the first place the majority state that the agency retain discretion to alter its course from the one pursue in the nox sip call and cair ante at but that miss the point the point be that epa have discretion to arrange thing so as to preserve the clean air act core principle of state primacy and that it be a abuse of discretion to refuse to do so see d a see also a identical text in the administrative procedure act indeed the proviso in c that the agency authority to promulgate a fip within the period terminate if the state correct the deficiency and epa approve the sip or sip revision explicitly contemplate just such a arrangement the majority conception of administrative discretion be so sprawl that it would allow epa to subvert state primacy not only with respect to the concern of the good neighbor provision but with respect to the much broader concern of the naaqs program more generally state must submit sip within year of each new or revise naaqs or such shorter period as epa may prescribe a emphasis add because there be no principled reason to read that scheduling provision in a less malleable manner than the one at issue here under the majority view epa could demand that states submit sip within a matter of day or even hour after a naaqs publication or else face the immediate imposition of fip the second element of plain text on which the majority rely be small beer indeed the good neighbor provision do not expressly state that epa must publish target quantity before the states be require to submit sip even though the clean air act do so for naaqs more generally and for vehicle inspection and maintenance program see c b from that premise the majority reason that h ad congress intend similarly to defer states discharge of they obligation under the good neighbor provision congress would have include a similar direction in that section ante at perhaps so but epa itself read the statute differently when it declare in the nox sip call that d etermine the overall level of air pollutant allow to be emit in a state be comparable to determine naaqs which the court have recognize as epa responsibility and be distinguishable from determine the particular mix of control among individual source to attain those standard which the caselaw identify as a state responsibility fed reg emphasis add the negative implication suggest by a statute failure to use consistent terminology can be a helpful guide to determine meaning especially when all the provision in question be enact at the same time which be not the case here but because that interpretive canon like other be just one clue to aid construction it can be overcome by more powerful indication of mean elsewhere in the statute it be we have say no more than a rule of thumb that can tip the scale when a statute could be read in multiple way sebelius auburn regional medical center slip at internal quotation mark and bracket omit the clean air act simply can not be read to make epa the primary regulator in this context the canon be easily overcome by the statute structure not to mention the sheer impossibility of submit a sensible sip without epa guidance negative implication be the tiniest mousehole in which the majority discover the elephant of federal control address the problem of interstate pollution in the manner congress have prescribe or in any other manner for that matter be a complex and difficult enterprise but r egardless of how serious the problem a administrative agency seek to address it may not exercise its authority in a manner that be inconsistent with the

no more than ton of subject to variation specify by epa see at table footnote similarly upwind states epa independently determine to be interfer ing with the maintenance of naaqs downwind be require to eliminate pollution only to the extent they emission satisfy both of these criterion see at footnote these fip specify the maximum amount of pollution each pollution source could emit source below this ceiling could sell unused allocation to source that could not reduce emission to the necessary level as cheaply see at this type of system cut cost while still reduce pollution to target level footnote three states do challenge epa determination see petition for review in ohio epa petition for review in kansas epa cadc notice in georgia epa cadc those challenge be not consolidate with this proceeding and they remain pend hold in abeyance for these case in the sixth and circuits see twelfth joint status report in ohio epa order in kansas epa cadc may order in georgia epa cadc may footnote the state respondent make a second argument we do not reach they urge that epa could not impose fip on several upwind states whose sip have be previously approve by the agency under cair epa change those approval to disapproval when it issue the transport rule see fed reg and the states assert that the process by which epa do so be improper that argument be not pass on by the circuit see and we leave it for the court of appeals to consider in the first instance on remand footnote on this point the dissent argue that it be beyond responsible debate that the states can not possibly design sip without know the target at which they must aim post at many of the state respondent think otherwise however when litigate the matter in michigan epa cadc see final brief for petitioning states in cadc epa have the responsibility to establish naaqs but without further intervention by epa states have the duty and right to develop sip to meet those naaqs see also at epa role be to determine whether the sip submit be adequate not to dictate contents of the submittal in the first instance e ach state have the right and the obligation to write a sip that comply with a include the good neighbor provision footnote in light of the caa core principle of cooperative federalism the dissent believe epa abuse its discretion by fail to give states a additional opportunity to submit sip in satisfaction of the good neighbor provision post at but nothing in the statute so restrict epa to the contrary as earlier observe see supra at the plain text of the caa grant epa plenary authority to issue a fip at any time within the period that begin the moment epa determine a sip to be inadequate c emphasis add footnote though we speak here of epa task the good neighbor provision be initially direct to upwind states as earlier explain
