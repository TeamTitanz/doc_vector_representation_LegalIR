allege unlawful employment practice by informal method of conference conciliation and persuasion b once the commission determine that conciliation have fail it may file suit in federal court f however n othing say or do during conciliation may be use as evidence in a subsequent proceeding without write consent of the person concern b after investigate a sex discrimination charge against petitioner mach mining llc respondent eeoc determine that reasonable cause exist to believe that the company have engage in unlawful hire practice the commission send a letter invite mach mining and the complainant to participate in informal conciliation proceedings and notify they that a representative would be contact they to begin the process about a year later the commission send mach mining another letter state that it have determine that conciliation effort have be unsuccessful the commission then sue mach mining in federal court in its answer mach mining allege that the commission have not attempt to conciliate in good faith the commission counter that its conciliation effort be not subject to judicial review and that regardless the two letter it send to mach mining provide adequate proof that it have fulfil its statutory duty the district court agree that it could review the adequacy of the commission effort but grant the commission leave to immediately appeal the seventh circuit reverse hold that the commission statutory conciliation obligation be unreviewable hold court have authority to review whether the eeoc have fulfil its title vii duty to attempt conciliation this court have recognize a strong presumption that congress mean to allow judicial review of administrative action bowen michigan academy of family physicians that presumption be rebuttable when a statute language or structure demonstrate that congress intend a agency to police itself block community nutrition institute but nothing rebut that presumption here by its choice of language congress impose a mandatory duty on the eeoc to attempt conciliation and make that duty a precondition to file a lawsuit such compulsory prerequisite be routinely enforce by court in title vii litigation and though congress give the eeoc wide latitude to choose which informal method to use it do not deprive court of judicially manageable criterion by which to review the conciliation process by its term the statutory obligation to attempt conciliation necessarily entail communication between the party concern the alleged unlawful employment practice the statute therefore require the eeoc to notify the employer of the claim and give the employer a opportunity to discuss the matter in enforce that statutory condition a court apply a manageable standard the appropriate scope of judicial review of the eeoc conciliation activity be narrow enforce only the eeoc statutory obligation to give the employer notice and a opportunity to achieve voluntary compliance this limited review respect the expansive discretion that title vii give the eeoc while still ensure that it follow the law the government suggestion that review be limit to check the facial validity of its two letter to mach mining fall short of title vii demand that standard would merely accept the eeoc word that it follow the law whereas the aim of judicial review be to verify that the eeoc actually try to conciliate a discrimination charge cite the standard set out in the national labor relations act mach mining propose review for whether the eeoc engage in negotiation lay out a number of specific requirement to implement that standard but the nlra approach provide a poor analogy for title vii which ultimately care about substantive outcome and eschew any reciprocal duty to negotiate in good faith mach mining propose code of conduct also conflict with the wide latitude congress give the commission to decide how to conduct and when to end conciliation effort and because information obtain during conciliation would be necessary evidence in a determination proceeding mach mining brand of review would violate title vii confidentiality protection the proper scope of review thus match the term of title vii conciliation provision in order to comply with that provision the eeoc must inform the employer about the specific discrimination allegation such notice must describe what the employer have do and which employee or class of employee have suffer and the eeoc must try to engage the employer in a discussion in order to give the employer a chance to remedy the allegedly discriminatory practice a swear affidavit from the eeoc state that it have perform these obligation should suffice to show that it have meet the conciliation requirement should the employer present concrete evidence that the eeoc do not provide the requisite information about the charge or attempt to engage in a discussion about conciliate the claim a court must conduct the factfind necessary to resolve that limited dispute should it find for the employer the appropriate remedy be to order the eeoc to undertake the mandate conciliation effort vacate and remand kagan deliver the opinion for a unanimous court opinion of the court notice this opinion be subject to formal revision before publication in the preliminary print of the united states reports reader be request to noti y the reporter of

discrimination the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc or commission must try to remedy unlawful workplace practice through informal method of conciliation this case require we to decide whether and how court may review those effort we hold that a court may review whether the eeoc satisfy its statutory obligation to attempt conciliation before file suit but we find that the scope of that review be narrow thus recognize the eeoc extensive discretion to determine the kind and amount of communication with a employer appropriate in any give case i title vii of the civil rights act of stat et set out a detailed procedure through which the commission enforce the statute prohibition on employment discrimination the process generally start when a person claim to be aggrieved file a charge of a unlawful workplace practice with the eeoc b at that point the eeoc notify the employer of the complaint and undertake a investigation see ibid if the commission find no reasonable cause to think that the allegation have merit it dismiss the charge and notify the party ibid the complainant may then pursue she own lawsuit if she choose see f if on the other hand the commission find reasonable cause it must first endeavor to eliminate the allege unlawful employment practice by informal method of conference conciliation and persuasion b to ensure candor in those discussion the statute limit the disclosure and use of the participant statement nothing say or do during and as a part of such informal endeavor may be publicize by the commission or use as evidence in a subsequent proceeding without the write consent of the person concern ibid the statute leave to the eeoc the ultimate decision whether to accept a settlement or instead to bring a lawsuit so long as the commission have be unable to secure from the respondent a conciliation agreement acceptable to the commission itself the eeoc may sue the employer f this case begin when a woman file a charge with the eeoc claim that petitioner mach mining llc have refuse to hire she as a coal miner because of she sex the commission investigate the allegation and find reasonable cause to believe that mach mining have discriminate against the complainant along with a class of woman who have similarly apply for mining job see app in a letter announce that determination the eeoc invite both the company and the complainant to participate in informal method of dispute resolution promise that a commission representative would soon contact they to begin the conciliation process at the record do not disclose what happen next but about a year later the commission send mach mining a second letter state that such conciliation effort as be require by law have occur and have be unsuccessful and that any further effort would be futile at the eeoc then sue mach mining in federal district court allege sex discrimination in hire the commission complaint maintain that a ll condition precedent to the institution of this lawsuit include a attempt to end the challenge practice through conciliation ha d be fulfil at in its answer mach mining contest that statement assert that the eeoc have fail to conciliat e in good faith prior to file suit at the commission subsequently move for summary judgment on that issue contend that its conciliation effort be not subject to judicial review motion for summary judgment in sd at most the commission argue the court could inspect the eeoc two letter to mach mining to confirm that the eeoc have meet its duty to attempt conciliation see at mach mining respond by urge the court to consider the overall reasonable ness of the eeoc effort base on evidence the company would present about the conciliation process memorandum in opposition to motion for partial summary judgment in sd the trial court agree with mach mining that it should review whether the commission have make a sincere and reasonable effort to negotiate civ sd app to pet for cert wl internal quotation mark omit at the eeoc request the court then authorize a immediate appeal of its ruling see civ sd may app to pet for cert wl b the court of appeals for the seventh circuit reverse hold that the statutory directive to attempt conciliation be not subject to judicial review accord to the court that provision entrust conciliation solely to the eeoc expert judgment and thus provide no workable standard of review for court to apply at the seventh circuit further reason that judicial review of the conciliation process would undermine enforcement of title vii by protract ing and complicat ing discrimination suit at quote doe oberweis diary in its conclude paragraph however the court indicate that it have in fact subject the eeoc activity to a smidgen of review because the commission plead on the face of its complaint that it ha d comply with all prerequisite to suit and because its two letter to mach mining be facially sufficient to show that conciliation have occur the court state we review of that process be satisfied at other court of appeals have hold that title vii allow judicial review of the eeoc conciliation effort but without agree on what that review entail we grant certiorari to address whether and to what extent such a attempt to conciliate be subject to judicial consideration ii congress rarely intend to prevent court from enforce its directive to federal agency for that reason this court apply a strong presumption favor judicial review of administrative action bowen michigan academy of family physicians that presumption be rebuttable it fail when a statute or structure demonstrate that congress want a agency to police its own conduct see block community nutrition institute but the agency bear a heavy burden in attempt to show that congress prohibit ed all judicial review of the agency compliance with a legislative mandate dunlop bachowski title vii as the government acknowledge impose a duty on the eeoc to attempt conciliation of a discrimination charge prior to file a lawsuit see brief for respondent that obligation be a key component of the statutory scheme in pursue the goal of bring ing employment discrimination to a end congress choose c ooperation and voluntary compliance as its prefer means ford motor eeoc quote alexander accordingly the statute provide as earlier note that the commission shall endeavor to eliminate a allege unlawful employment practice by informal method of conference conciliation and persuasion b see supra at that language be mandatory not precatory national railroad passenger corporation morgan note that the word shall admit of no discretion and the duty it impose serve as a necessary precondition to file a lawsuit only if the commission be unable to secure a acceptable conciliation agreement that be only if its attempt to conciliate have fail may a claim against the employer go forward f court routinely enforce such compulsory prerequisite to suit in title vii litigation and in many other context besides a employee for example may bring a title vii claim only if she have first file a timely charge with the eeoc and a court will usually dismiss a complaint for failure to do so see at similarly a employee must obtain a letter before bring suit and a court will typically insist on satisfaction of that condition see mcdonnell douglas green see also hallstrom tillamook county uphold dismissal of a environmental suit for failure to comply with a notice provision serve as a condition precedent united states zucca affirm dismissal of a denaturalization suit because of the government failure to comply with a mandatory prerequisite that ordinary part of title vii litigation see a prerequisite to suit enforce a prerequisite to suit support judicial review of the eeoc compliance with the law conciliation provision the government reiterate the seventh circuit view contest that conclusion argue that title vii provide no standard by which to judge the eeoc performance of its statutory duty brief for respondent the government highlight the broad leeway the statute give the eeoc to decide how to engage in and when to give up on conciliation in grant that discretion the government contend congress deprive court of any judicially manageable criterion with which to review the eeoc effort at quote heckler chaney and in that way congress demonstrate d its intention to preclude judicial review brief for respondent but in thus deny that title vii create a reviewable prerequisite to suit the government take its observation about discretion too far at quote at yes the statute provide the eeoc with wide latitude over the conciliation process and that feature become significant when we turn to define the proper scope of judicial review see infra at but no congress have not leave everything to the commission consider if the eeoc decline to make any attempt to conciliate a claim if after find reasonable cause to support a charge the eeoc take the employer straight to court in such a case title vii would offer a perfectly serviceable standard for judicial review without any endeavor at all the eeoc would have fail to satisfy a necessary condition of litigation still more the statute provide certain concrete standard pertain to what that endeavor must entail again think of how the statute describe the obligatory attempt to eliminate the allege unlawful employment practice by informal method of conference conciliation and persuasion b those specify method necessarily involve communication between party include the exchange of information and view as one dictionary variously define the term they involve consultation or discussion a attempt to reconcile different position and a means of argument reasoning or entreaty american heritage dictionary ed that communication moreover concern a particular thing the allege unlawful employment practice so the eeoc to meet the statutory condition must tell the employer about the claim essentially what practice have harm which person or class and must provide the employer with a opportunity to discuss the matter in a effort to achieve voluntary compliance see also infra at if the commission do not take those specify action it have not satisfied title vii requirement to attempt conciliation and in insist that the commission do so as the statutory language direct a court apply a manageable standard absent such review the commission compliance with the law would rest in the commission hand alone we need not doubt the eeoc trustwor
